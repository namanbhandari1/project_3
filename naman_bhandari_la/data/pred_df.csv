1,Damn those nighttime centipedes/Silverfish. Damn them all to hell! Was sitting at my PC with the lights off watching a YouTube video. Noticed what I thought was small object move across my keyboard. Couldn't see it really because it too dark. Flicked the desk lamp on and right in front of me sitting on the edge of the keyboard was that big leggy bastard.  I hate Silverfish because they are hard to capture and if I fail and they wriggle free I jump out the nearest window. üòÆ,0.31500712365433164,0

Hey guys, I'm writing this post because another summer has come to an end and I've still never went out to party, fallen in love, kissed anyone. I havent had anyone to talk to for about 4 years now. My parents are not understanding of my situation. They mainly just say ""man up"" or ""you're just a teen, it'll go away"". I've been alone ever since we moved countries 4 summers ago. I left behind all my friends and ever since, even though I've been trying to contact them online, I could feel them slowly losing interest in me. Now I don't talk to them anymore and I have nobody I could tell my feelings to. I just feel worthless and unwanted, like I'm a nuisance to anyone around me. I have zero self confidence and I hate my body, face, acne. I've built up all of these profound emotions inside of me over the past years and I have nobody/nothing to let them out on.

6,"I give up on trying to do anything I used to draw hamsters all the time  All the time!!!!  When I met this local girl from the local store ""made in japan"" that plays anime and they just sell manga and anime/manga merchandise, that kept asking me to draw hamsters on her Oekaki that she made.  Then my best friend for 15 years, the guy that makes everyone hate me and like him instead and he makes lots of sexual jokes about my friends and he calls them ""my girls"" and I keep getting mad at him saying that they aren't mine and I don't care what gender they are, and he always said he has to unparty with me in online games because he said I'm embarrassing, and he yells at me in online games (but quits when he's ""embarrassed from losing"" and tells me not to tell the other people why he left) and he literally told me a few times that he Uses me to play video games and he doesn't really like me, and after I wrote a poem about how he's my best friend, he did a sexual roleplay with me and then afterwards told me that he doesn't really like me at all and was pretending that I was a girl he liked the entire time;  he said I'm ""not funny unless its on accident"" when I showed him footage of my Rita's Adventure game.  Then on a discord server, I won't say which one, like 8 months ago they found my tumblr and they kept linking to my hamster drawings: https://i.imgur.com/Dih40um.png  They kept making fun of it!! Two people in the discord server kept saying ""Oh yeah, you can't draw humans, but you can draw hamsters REAL GOOD"" sarcastically and then a bunch of people kept making fun of my hamster drawings.  So I gave up ever since they made fun of my art.  I posted about it on a forum and they told me ""Well yeah, there's two types of people: Those with talent and those without it. I can tell you, without a single doubt, you're one of those people with absolutely no talent at all. Don't worry about it"" and lots of people hit like on his post.  All I wanna do is make games and make art but people don't like them.  I linked to a cool RPG Maker 2003 game I made in year 2004, on the Discord I'm in, and someone there that's literally 13 years old but is always there, said that the game looks horrible on first glance and he told me that this is what gamers want their games to look like, and he kept linking to videos of Uncharted 4 for the PS4.  I live with my parents and I don't have a job, I don't think I can make a hamster game that has graphics as good as Uncharted 4.  He kept saying he looked at the video of my game and exited in less than 2 seconds.  He said I didn't highlight anything good about my game in my video.  Dude there's so many hidden treasure chests.. You play as my ex-girlfriend's Hamtaro OC (it was originally a gift for her when she met me again) and she fights by summoning Simba from The Lion King to fight Fuzzy Lumpkins from the Powerpuff Girls.  I even hired someone to draw art for it: https://i.imgur.com/HT61b83.jpg  I just give up. I just want people to support me. The end of it all completely was when stuff that made me depressed happened, that I can't talk about publicly.  blah  I wish I kept drawing hamsters but I can't cuz I remember 8 months ago when the two people in a Discord kept making fun of my hamster drawings.  Now I'm hiring this person to draw hamsters for the comic and games I'm making instead: https://i.imgur.com/VOk2lAJ.jpg I wish I could draw for it instead, but I feel too bad about the people on a discord server making fun of my art 8 months ago..

I was leaving this out before.....but considering I'm the one that pays all the bills and takes care of all the pets, and no I don't take care of the house or cleaning or whatever, but after spending about 20 hours a day for the past week and most days prior to that 16 hours a day between school and work, I'm kind of sick of it.

33,"A sudden bout of depression, and a self realization. I just made this account, as an alternate to post and read about this type of thing, because something happened yesterday, that put a giant hurricane over my little corner of sunshine. The one place I like to go, that I made, to escape my anxiety and depression. So, with that place suddenly clouded, I'm in a pretty good bout of depression.I can't eat when I'm hungry, I can't enjoy things I usually do, and all I want to do is sleep.  I was talking to a friend about it last night, who was involved and understands where I'm coming from, and I kept comparing my feelings to BoJack Horseman, and anyone who has seen the show, is aware of how well it depicts depression and other mental illness. The show often shows what's going on in his head, and how his thoughts just spiral and spiral, until he has to yell at himself to shut up. And that is how I've been feeling the last two days.  But I came to the realization, that I'm not really like Bojack...and I'm actually much more like Mr. Peanutbutter. (hence the profile name)  In the show, Mr. Peanutbutter is seen as the happiest character in the show. He always seems to find a silver lining in even the worst of situations. He's so upbeat nearly all the time, it seems like he's immune to negative feelings, and that's how I seem to be most the time. I generally am pretty happy, despite having depression and anxiety, I've always found ways of coping with it well, but when those methods of coping are compromised, like right now, I don't know what to do, and can't find enjoyment in anything.  Like Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm quick to forgive, I like to make others feel better, and pull them out of bad mindsets. I'm a great listener, and people are comfortable coming to me to vent. And I'm totally ok with that, and do all I can to make them feel better, and heard.  It's easy for me to see the silver lining, but my constant want to avoid the dark clouds in my own life, and when I am forced to, especially in my places to escape, I do become depressed like this, and can't find positivity in anything. When I'm used to being able to do so, and just kind of get lost, and just want to sleep. Uninspired, unmotivated, and bored.  I'm hoping this passes soon, but let me tell you, it can't pass quick enough.

I don't deserve so much pain. I didn't ask for such a fucked up brain. My mental handicap is ruining my life. I see no way out. I will never be financially independent and I will never get to live a nice comfortable life. I have always been the dumbest of the dumb. my brain is just shit. I can't talk to anyone, any kind of conversation is ridiculously difficult for me. I have yet to develop any kind of social skill. I was born to stupid poor parents who didn't get me diagnosed earlier. So I don't have a official diagnosis. But I am pretty sure I am one of the unfortunate victims of autism.  I am currently 22, probably the only guy in the whole planet that's so dumb. I have been fucked by people my whole life. I have PTSD due to bullying that won't go away. It's been like this for one year. I am convinced it will never get better. Due to my PTSD I can't enjoy anything. I feel like shit all the time. I have so much pain in my heart that it feels like it's gonna explode.   As I said, PTSD joined the fun one year ago. It all started from a bullying incident working with some people at my uni. Before this I never had such a condition. After that incident, I remember all the times I have been bullied and it feels like someone is forcefully bending me over and fucking me in the ass. I feel so powerless in life and it makes me feel the worst mental pain ever. It's been like this for a WHOLE year. The worst part is when I run into my bullies at my uni. My mind feels like it's gonna snap in half. I want to hurt them but I can't. They have way to many connections for that and I will get in serious trouble.  I also have really scary nightmares after being in so much pain and stress all day. Today I had two of them in a series. My heart feels like it's gonna stop. Such a life isn't worth it if I can't even afford to sleep in peace.  I am fucking poor and don't have access to most of the things I want. I have no friends, no one in this world to care about my problems. That makes me feel even more shit.  Once I had a childish dream of making it big someday. Now I know it was just bullshit I absorbed from movies. Sure, there are many rags to riches stories out there. IMHO I think all of them are made up. It doesn't make any sense to me that people influential as Elon Musk was bullied when he was younger. There is no way Jack ma failed that many interviews. These people are smart af and there is no way they were once that weak in life. These are stories made up by media to make people work harder and increase profit for The Elites.  Writing this post I recall a quote from the movie 'The Shawshank Redemption' - ""Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.""  My misery has turned me into a monster. I no longer have any concern for anyone's well-being. I couldn't care less if world war 3 started or a country was nuked. I used to be a very kind person. But not anymore. My brain is full of so many painful memories that I can't even care for my own life.   The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I am afraid of the pain the comes with the methods I can afford - hanging, jumping from roof stuff like that.

52,"What's the point ? do read as it may be the last thing i ever write. I was born in a family which was financially stable, Good caring and loving parents and also three siblings.   All four of us have been creative in their own fields, but i was also good at studies so it had always been through me my parents fulfilled their desire of an academically successful child. Now when i'm 22 things have changed a little. My eldest brother has become the Black Sheep of the Family, My Elder sister is just doing fine (But since i'm in India her success doesn't really matter that much to my parents because there are three brothers in the house which sucks man just sucks.) and my younger brother is still is in his freshmen year. So ultimately for present i'm left with the burden to get the good Job, earn the most for the family and take up responsibilities and everyone has high hopes from me and why not i've shown good academic records during school and also decent grades in college so yeah. But what everyone in my family is ignoring is the fact that i'm not the same guy anymore. College was the first time i actually experienced a little freedom before that i used to go to school and come back home. Me and my siblings weren't allowed to go out of the house to any friend or relative, to hangout at places with friends, get some fresh air because my parents are very scared of something bad happen to us and none of us had the courage to stand up because if somehow we tried they always had their reason which seemed legit. In college also i was scared of going out because of staying in one place for 12 years my psychology had become like that but i eventually made friends and soon after my freshen year ended i got into bad habits of Smoking and Drinking all in order to get some friends. I won't lie but my friend circle expanded and it was fun. i enjoyed my time. But with the enjoyment came bad Grades, Loss of Focus and Concentration, Inability to take responsibilities, bad circadian rhythms..... all the while this was happening things at the house were not so good because of my elder brother and my parents were most of the time worried about him so i never really told them anything about me and it also felt like a weak thing to be 20 yrs old and not be able to handle my shit. So i smoked and smoked and just by chance did get a job but got rejected later because of poor grades. So now i'm 22, unemployed and stuck at home again (no freedom) unable to get myself back together because of 3 years of brain damage due to Smoking Cheap marijuana, cigarette and alcohol. Parents are nice and keeping me for now but they are still expecting a good career from me which to be honest i know i can't give them at least not for now. All i do is play video games all day as an escape which hurts them like hell and they think i'll also become like my elder brother.  Can't tell them that i'm sad because it'll hurt them more and make them more sad and they already have a lot on their plate.    I just don't have any willpower to do anything. Earlier i had goals and ambitions to reach but now nothing. Now i just want someone to provide me with basic necessities of life like food, shelter, water and internet so i can play videogames and not do anything.    And any sane man knows that such a person will not survive in this world. So i ask what's the point of living when i know how life is going to be which is just more misery for my loved ones. Why not get euthanasia (because i'm a coward and i can't handle the sight of blood) and die.    YOu can say you never know what's in the bag for you or what might lie ahead or some miracle might happen but these are things i've been hearing since the last 8 years either online or through some motivating personality and frankly i've only gone downhill.

53,"What the West has all wrong. Why is there no longer any sense of community in Western Culture and is this why were all so miserable? Long read bare with me.  So at a time where my depression/anxiety was at its peak I moved to Padang in Indonesia for a research project, a strict muslim city in West Sumatra with no tourists and very little English speaking. Surprisingly, I gave so little of a shit about my life by this point and I‚Äôve travelled a lot  previously so this didnt really excite or scare me.  As I learnt in the proceeding months, the Padang people share coffee, food, cigarettes and prayer together; every single day. When I first met some local people, I found this focus on sharing and community weird and really tiring, and in the afternoon to night they would tell me to stay longer with them and my anxiety and over politeness would stop me from leaving. This happened every day and with different people (forcing of friendship is common for their entire community). At first it really spiked my anxiety.  But in the coming weeks something really strange happened; I grew to love sharing this time with these people each day and began to willingly meet them at the local coffee shop. We spoke in Pidgen (broken English) mixed with my terrible Indonesian, in conversations of little to no consequence and we laughed over dumb things that would be considered ‚Äòunsophisticated‚Äô or uncool back in my ‚Äòscene‚Äô back home. Hell, to be completely honest I had nothing really in common with my main group of friends here.   I just stopped giving a fuck about social norms and my confidence skyrocketted. my work started writting itself during the days, and I‚Äôd race down to the coffee shop every afternoon where I could spend 8 hours with my mates until 4 in the morning. I even picked up my long lost guitar hobby again.... These people were all poor as shit but every time they were together they smiled and laughed all night. They didnt care about their problems because they had a community.  One day, a few months in, I met a tourist who I brought to the coffee shop I‚Äôd been going to every night. She was so weirded out, and didnt understand how I got along so well with all these random Indonesian guys given there is such a massive language barrier. It was at this point I realised I had my arm around a bloke I considered a really good mate, but he only knew about 100 words in English. We looked at eachother, shrugged our shoulders and laughed; we didnt know either.  When I left these guys, it was the best I‚Äôd ever felt; only  4 months after feeling the worst Id ever felt getting on the plane. That feeling of friendship and community had empowered me and driven away all of the nihilistic angst and self criticism that filled my days. The negative thoughts just disappeared despite the fact I was fatter, slept less and picked up a cigarette addiction....  Upon return to my regular life in Australia, within a month I had graduated and received a job offer for the company I‚Äôd always wanted to work for. Its worth mentioning I live in a beautiful, beachy tourist destination and Padang city itself isn‚Äôt anything special.... Yet still, I can feel the mental health problems returning as Im back here.  I want to say hello everyone at my coffee shop, and enjoy company and discussion with strangers on the bus. I want to know the names of everyone I work with and enjoy that same sense of communitty but its not the same here. People dont respond to it, and if you put too much energy into talking to people they just think you‚Äôre weird.... Its like theres this rule book for social engagement that is holding us all back. I cant I even talk to a girl on the street without feeling like Im harassing her.  Theres so much more context to what I‚Äôve begun thinking, but I wanna talk about why we are like this? Why are these social constraints holding us back so much and increasingly so? And where can we find that same sense of community in Western culture?",0.5667235536836374,1

I have discontinued all contact with her, and blocked her on all social media. I don't need the toxicity of her in my already kinda stressful life  Kayla claims to have so many problems (mental and physical.) However, many of these are fake. I give the benefit of the doubt and will believe what you tell me. But, then I started noticing things. Firstly, Kayla would use her 'illnesses' as an excuse for things. Like ""oh, I can't do *insert thing here* because of my anxiety"" or something like that.   Also, I have problems myself (mental, not sure about medical. Other than a nose bleeding problem, but that is nothing serious, a trip to the ENT will cover that) but, she claims because she has more problems and that they are more severe that she knows more about the problems and that she also can basically take control over me, be smarter and better than me.   Kayla is quite popular and stuff and does cheer-leading, gymnastics, dance (i think), volleyball, soccer (i'm not sure if there is anything else.) Not far too long ago, I did some research. With her claims on some of the 'conditions' she has, she would not be able to do any of the sports or any sports at all really.  Also, she claims she has epileptic seizures (Photosensitive epilepsy to be specific) Here are two straight out reasons that's clearly a lie. 1) She went to a f***ing Taylor Swift concert (that is flashing lights galore, you would probably not survive that or something) 2) I have never seen her take medications (I have been over to her house plenty of times, including for sleepovers and had never seen her take a single medication)  She also claims to have autism. Which kinda hits close to home for me. I have a family friend with autism. I know there are different types on the Autism Spectrum but she has 0 signs/symptoms of any of them.   She just claims to have so many things she doesn't have. Is the possibility of munchausen syndrome there, well possibly. Like I said often i give the benefit of the doubt, this could be a case of it.

64,"My miracle - should it be of any help. First off, I'd like to provide some background information about me. I'm a 21 year old brazilian male who lives in Guarulhos, S√£o Paulo (so excuse me for my english beforehand). I've been battling depression/anxiety since I was 16. The most obvious causes (or symptoms) of my problem seem to be social isolation, and general overthinking existentialism (also the quiet likely chemical imbalance). I started treatment about two and a half years ago at a point in which I was already in really bad shape, and my problem seemed to have become chronic. I struggle a lot with religion and as of now am not affiliated in any. I used to be Catholic and took it pretty seriously for about two years before some things started to make no sense anymore. My family is split Catholic/Kardecism (which I've also flirted with). I have been committed to a psych ward in the beginning of 2017 due to feeling anxious and suicidal. I couldn't stay there as I was assaulted by another patient in an incident. I take fluoxetine (which will be replaced), lithium, citalopram, risperidone and the occasional benzodiazepine. I am in therapy. I have tried meditation and hypnosis (gotta take a better shot at the former). I have also tried homeopathy.  I have never attempted suicide, although getting really close to. I think we're now good for me to tell the story.      Earlier this year I lost my job. I was working at ‚ÄúDetran‚Äù, which in the US would be the DMV. A fairly simple six hour job that was helping me get by and keep my head busy. Feeling guilty and hopeless about being unable to hold a job or even keep my mind clear for a second, I felt like I was losing my sanity, and became increasingly suicidal again. I was desperate and wanted to be committed to a psych ward again so I wouldn‚Äôt hurt myself. At this period I was praying a lot, even though not participating in any religious affiliation anymore. I was obsessed about thoughts of the existence of god, the supernatural, the afterlife, you name it. I was holding on to stories I've heard from my family about inexplicable events to account for the existence of the spiritual world, which gave me hope (even though some of the stories aren't exactly cute). An example of that would be my mother dreaming of my deceased grandmother bringing her babies that would be born in the family - this happened three times in which my mother would know the gender and appearance of the babies before they were born. Another example (more extreme) would be of my mother meeting my deceased grandmother's spirit while awake, having an out of body experience - that same day, my aunt also felt my grandmother's presence and cried (they talked on the phone later that day). There are other stories, but I can't afford sharing all of them now. I'll just go straight to the point.     My mother owns a cake shop near where we live. All sorts of people come by as you might guess. One day a woman came by and told her to paint the walls orange for prosperity, my mom dismissed the comment and told me about it later as I wasn't there that day. So the next day, with a lot of persistence my mom convinces me to come with her to the shop, not wanting to leave me alone in the apartment. So I do. We open by nine, and by ten-ish the woman from the previous day returns and greets me, saying she needs to talk to my mother. She says she couldn't sleep and that God had touched her heart. She needed to gives us a thousand reais (which would be something like three hundred dollars, sorry, don't know the exchange rate). We were of course shocked and refused, afraid of being scammed at first. She explained she didn't know why she had to, but this had happened before. Once she had met a saleswoman on the beach, felt touched, and gave her money - as it turns out, this woman was going to be evicted. Similarly, she had passed by a car dealership, felt touched to enter and offer money: the owner was about to have his electricity cut off that day. She explained she dealed with properties and was relatively well-off. Plus, she owned a hair salon nearby. She called in people to testify in her favor ‚Äì her daughter, tenant. They all testified in her favor, told us she was a by all means honest woman, and advised us to accept our blessing. Still we refused, acknowledging the fact we didn‚Äôt know her nor felt comfortable with the situation, even if it meant rejecting our blessing. We are middle-class, pay rent and struggle, but we‚Äôre also not in need of anything.   The woman insisted a lot, told us she was a Protestant, and attested to the fact that this sort of thing happens for a reason. At last, she was going to wait for a mutual friend that works in a shop right next to ours to come, someone that we knew to testify in her favor ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt there at that moment. So she asked for a cup of coffee and sat down. My mom headed back to the kitchen, and I stayed at the counter. We served her. Right after that, the woman started singing quietly. It was a hymn, and my mother could hear it. When she did, she asked me if I could hear her singing too, and I told her I did. She told me that was my grandmother‚Äôs favorite hymn ‚Äì as she was a Protestant too. My mother said she was praying in the kitchen for a sign when this happened. I was stupefied the whole time, couldn‚Äôt believe the entire thing. My mother told the woman what just happened, and decided to keep the money. They were crying and hugging - I still wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of anything. The woman got her credit card and debited it right there. She explained she would never return to collect, or charge for the money or anything. Soon after that, she left.   This happened on March this year. As I absorbed what happened, I tried to make sense of it. I am still dumbfounded. I am a skeptical person, and every time I tell this story I know inside that it‚Äôs me that I‚Äôm still trying to convince. I am still trying to understand. But it still gets a little crazier. As months went by, I looked for the woman to thank her, and explain to her what that had meant for us. So I did ‚Äì she wasn‚Äôt hard to find, because as I explained she owned a hair salon nearby. While we were talking she revealed to me she knew I was depressed beforehand and that God had ‚Äúshowed me bare‚Äù to her. Afterwards, she invited me to her church. I was a little upset and thought that that was her trying to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù me or get me to join in her church ‚Äì which I explained I probably wouldn‚Äôt do as I had gotten out the Catholic church recently and was feeling suspicious and distant about the whole thing. Still, she insisted I came by at least once, for God ‚Äúwas going to talk to me‚Äù there. I did go, and fair enough, the sermon had a lot to do with my situation ‚Äì it discussed depression and feeling abandoned by god. Nevertheless, religion was still having an upsetting effect on me, and even though the sermon really did seem to be somehow directed at me, it‚Äôs not like I had a revelation or anything. I was kind of bummed, thinking God was trying to talk to me in many ways but I was still having a hard time feeling better, and not being able to help being so skeptical.  After all that happened, I still found myself in a bad place, not being able to make sense of so many things, and having to deal with low-mood and episodes. Not soon after that, I wanted to be committed to a psych ward yet again, afraid of hurting myself. The day we were searching for a clinic, I got a new job, and decided to stick it out. Getting that job was a very interesting thing, and there I met two people who had similar problems to mine. I lost that job also, but managed to make very meaningful connections to my workmates ‚Äì including sharing this story to them in the intention of helping them. As of now, I am kind of messy and trying to get by. If I were to tell you what I think about this story I would say: I do believe it was a supernatural occurrence, and I do believe that was God‚Äôs way of showing me he exists, and that the spiritual world is real (by telling us my grandmother is watching us). The odds are just so crazy. I was praying specifically for a sign for months (even though in Christianity you‚Äôre not exactly encouraged to do so) so I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself because I just couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. And that week I had been thinking hard about all my grandmother‚Äôs stories to believe in something ‚Äì I never met her because she passed away before I was born. Then this happens. Out of nowhere, on an ordinary day, right in front of me.   I feel very split about telling this story. It‚Äôs a serious story from despair ‚Äì nothing I take lightly ‚Äì and it seems to be meant for desperate people too (not only though). I admit I am very wary about the reactions. The first thing about it is that people might think it‚Äôs not real, for which I can‚Äôt really say anything, but ask them to take my word for it, and that for obvious reasons I can‚Äôt be more specific about it ‚Äì place, people involved. Second, but also related to the first, that this story is intended to proselytize, recruit, or evangelize ‚Äì as I explained I am not a part of any religious affiliation, and this is not advocating any. Third, but related to the formers, that it‚Äôs real intention might not be well received ‚Äì but that‚Äôs a risk I have to take. It‚Äôs intention is indeed one of faith in God. I don‚Äôt mean this to have any sort of hidden agenda, and I am well aware that all interpretations and points of view are beyond my grasp, that there is really no control to what people can make of this ‚Äì I probably shouldn‚Äôt even worry about it, but hey. Part of the problem of believing in God is the difficulty in knowing him, so what I believe in is the initiative in getting to know him ‚Äì why we would not want the most precious thing we could have? This is another reason why I would never make up something like this: this is indeed a story for desperate people. And I, like for myself, don‚Äôt want anybody else to feed themselves with illusions in order to overcome whatever they have to. I believe that true strength can never come from lies. And faith should not the opposite of reason, it should be based on it.  That being said, although I‚Äôm keen on justifications, I never had to look too much around to hear the strangest stories from all kinds of people, and I guess you don‚Äôt have to dig that deep either. Mystery is a fact. I shall not linger any further, I hope the massage is received, and I‚Äôll be available for questions.  Sorry for maybe not being succinct enough, but as Mark Twain once said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one‚Äù.  TLDR; A miracle has happened to me, and I am still holding on because of it. There are reasons to believe.  --- Please tell me if I should make any corrections.",0.48050294414377814,1
65,"..... Three years ago, I took a job in a lab a different state. I didn't like it, and I resented that I was isolated. I applied to grad schools, and got into a few places. I got into a few places, including one where my girlfriend was moving to. I felt shame about moving just because my girlfriend was, so I rescinded my decision about going there, and asked to be readmitted into the grad school close to the lab I hated, because it was more prestigious. They told me I could be readmitted for the following school year. I said fine, and quit my job, moved to where my girlfriend was, and just sat around doing nothing for a year. I felt shame. I left her, moved back to the place I hated, doing something I hated, because I was unable to get my shit together otherwise. Now I've completed a year of grad school, I hate the lab I'm in, I need help and I can't ask for it. I have a lot of resentment, and I can't sleep because what I'm doing is so far against what I want to be doing. The days are anger, jealousy, resentment and boredom, the nights are anger, fear, and sleeplessness. I hate myself and I often want to die. This is a cry for help. I want out of this situation I made for myself, but no one will help me. All I know is that I can't keep going on like this, it's not good for me. I don't know how to quit, and I don't know how to ask for help from people that can actually help me. I exhausted most of my connections with the same story over and over again. fuck this. I hate this.  &amp;#x200B;  I frequently tell myself to be quiet because I should be grateful that my situation isn't worse.

66,"Some symptoms I have which I wanted to know if and of you guys felt too. Sometimes it's hard to verbalize quite what this depression feels like. I did my best to compile a list of everything I can think of associated with how I am feeling and I wanted to know if you guys had these things too.  - Gradual decrease in pleasure taken in anything like music, hobbies, socialization etc. **and** you are able to pinpoint a time when it began. You weren't just depressed all your life but there was a distinct month or year where you began to notice yourself slipping and desparately trying to enjoy things again.   - A feeling of literal, almost physical emptiness in your abdominal cavity which is constantly present even when you're not actively thinking about it. It's like a princess and the pea thing where you are in constant discomfort because of this feeling and you are never able to fully relax even if you try your best to do so. It creates a sense of restlessness which never stops and you externalize it in some type of fidgeting or scab picking.  - A sense of time in which weeks and months go by so rapidly that you can't seem to catch up with your own life.  - A loss of a sense of home. You get travel anxiety when you are gone from home for a short couple days, but when you finally get home it is not alleviated. You feel a sense of displacement everywhere and can never find a sense of belonging.   - Emotional stifling in physical contact. You feel nothing in a hug or a kiss anymore. There is no emotional reward in a family or an intimate relationship.   - You have less of a concrete internal monologue and your thoughts are less of a ""stream of consciousness"" and more of a soup of random memories phasing in and out for no particular purpose. There is no cohesive narrative in your chain of thought. It is a thick fog with people and places and events appearing in faint shadows at random intervals.  - Anything which takes a modicum of physical or intellectual effort, such as taking a shower or reading, is met with a vicious, almost physical resistance from your psyche and you more or less loose command over your own will. The idea of doing something productive through your own will is met with an insurmountable force against you by your own body and mind.  - An extreme reduction in your capacity to remember things even as simple as the yesterday's events. You're constantly forgetting what day it is and are constantly missing important appointments because you simply do not recall that you have any until it is too late.  - You have totally lost a sense of empathy and live as it were a consciousness in a lonely emptiness because you can't muster the ability to care about the feelings of others if it does not relate to yourself in some way.  - Simultaneously putting yourself on this pedistal of outerworldly narcissism while loathing everything about yourself at the same time.  - A sense that your potential is constantly being choked off by lack of willpower or motivation.  - You are so disconnected from the present that every moment feels as if it were a dream. Your sense of concrete reality has faded and has given way to constant fuzzyness.",0.9384659457109139,1

68,"Today I got some bad news at my job After an absolutely awesome August I felt on top of the world and motivated to move forward and progress in my career after a period of stagnation.  I found out due to some issues with my application that I had to leave my post and go back to my old role in a contact centre. I severely hated this job, and I am devastated I have to go back.   I just have this feeling that I am destined for failure. I am 31, this is the first time I have progressed in any role through my life. And within 6 months I am gone, I'm back to the same old shit.  I have had a troubled upbringing having been with multiple Foster parents due to my mums drug and alcohol abuse, abandoned by my mum when I eventually moved back with her, she lied about me to her mum to get what she wanted out of her and before my gran died whilst on her death bed my mum told me that my gran didn't even like me, I fucked up my adolescent life through a series of poor life choices, then I started to realise something had to change.  I have been making positive strides over the past decade to try to overcome the barriers that have been put in front of me, and the ones I created for myself. It has been hard I have had ups and downs, I always just kept on trying, through all of my bouts of depression. Right now, after this most recent set back I feel like I am destined for failure and I should just sit on the bottom of the ladder and not even try. I don't care about the job but my self esteem has really taken a beating, even after I had such an amazing month where I really did get boosted by so many people friends and strangers alike.   I have cut ties with my family and don't contact them anymore, I am too embarrassed to talk to my friends about it because I have been riding such a crest for the past few weeks and have been so upbeat I don't want to show myself like this.

This isn't one of those ""I'm a freshman in college and I still haven't found my people"" stories (actually, I'm a third year but the rest still applies). My freshman year and my sophomore year I went into with a lot of hope and with and open mind. I tried to make friends, joined clubs, was accepted into my dream major etc. Now going into junior year, I'm just tired. I don't have any passion for my major anymore (or anything else), I haven't made friends with people I feel like I really click with like my friends at home. I just moved into a nice apartment this year, which was the only thing I was excited for, but I get really strong anxiety from background noises and my neighbors are never quiet, even on weeknights at 2am they are blasting music and screaming.  The noise has brought me into sobbing anxiety attacks and I get anxious even thinking about coming back to my apartment. I don't want my friends or my boyfriend from back home realizing how sad I am here without them so I don't want to talk to them, and here I don't have any drive to speak to or hang out with anyone other than my roommates, which sucks because I know I'm a very social person when I'm happy and that's where I get my energy from. I don't have anyone to talk to in any of my classes either, which makes each day more and more depressing. I really just don't want to be here but I don't have a plan b if I drop out.

My family keeps talking about me because I apparently ""never show emotion"" or ""empathy"" or  how I never call or message or think or even care about anyone at all.  Yeah. I don't really care too much. They are right.  I don't have friends because there is an ""impenetrable wall"" protecting a ""never ending confusion mess of a maze"" that is my brain. This means I rarely ever share things about myself and conversations tend to be about the other person or just for jokes where I don't need to give my opinion . And when I share shit about me people leave cause im oversharing. If not people leave cause I never start conversations or because of this or because of that.  Yes. I have an explanation for all of that. I have an explanation to not talking to you lot. I have a reason to ""isolate myself in my own world"". First of all, fuck you, because you don't know what my world is. I do this because not only am I an introvert, I am also tired  I am tired of how society works, im tired of talking, im tired of trying, im tired of getting out of bed, im tired of living... I am just tired of this world. Everything feels the same. Why bother discussing a topic with someone that thinks they are always right? What's the point in discussing a topic with someone that doesn't admit when they are right ? What's the point in discussing a topic when they agree with you? What is ever the point in discussing a topic, really?  I don't talk to you because I don't have anything to say either.

What's the point in keeping up with society? It's all about presenting ourselves as the prettiest smartest and wealthiest no matter what. All about hopping on the next trend and post a picture on Instagram of our perfect shitty flawed bodies to get likes for validation from other sorry excuses of living things, except we forget they don't care. No one does. The worst is if you don't follow such trends you are judged.  And what's the deal with people giving their opinions like they are fucking facts? Do they seriously think they are worth that much? That's just sad.   Really, what's the point in doing anything if you're not even going to live your 20s? There isn't one. I am cold and numb. I don't care about your shit. Not your existence, not your problems, not your wealth, not your social status. I don't care about the trend or how important studying or exercising is. I don't act upon any responsibilities either. Say whatever you want, you know in the end im the one that's going to end up alone. And it will all be my fault. I know that.

If we had, we'd end up in another fucking fight with you. But I guess it's okay when you do it to us right?    3. You refuse to apologize for any of your mistakes. Instead, you ever so slightly change your mind and expect everyone to just go with the flow, because it suits you best.

91,"Depressed on Family Vacation I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I'm saving as much money as I can to move out, but right now it isn't paramount because my uni is in the same city they live in and it's not like I'm being abused or anything. But I really cannot wait to move out for many reasons, and being depressed on family vacation is one of the many.  I don't remember exactly for how long I despised family vacations, but I just have. It's not that I hate my family, but as a common teenage/young adult problem they can get pretty insufferable. Firstly, it always seems like we just HAVE to go to the beach. Pretty common vacation spot, I know. However, I basically hate every single thing about the beach. I hate the sand (because, you know, it's course and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere), saltwater, the smell, the heat (and accompanying sweating), getting sunburnt, wearing sunscreen, wearing bathing suits (hell yeah, body image issues), and being around so many other people while wearing a bathing suit while feeling extremely insecure about it. Every time I tell my parents that I don't want to go to the beach with them, she just says ""Well, sometimes we need to do things we don't like."" as if being bored or something is equivalent to wanting to cry and bury yourself in a hole and cover yourself up with 20 towels because you hate your body so much. Of course, if I push the issue and actually get to stay in the hotel we stay at, I'm the party pooper that doesn't want anyone to have fun.  Another reason really is that I can't smoke regularly. Yeah yeah, smoking is bad, I get it. But I'm used to smoking after every meal, otherwise I feel extremely bloated and gross. The drive we made over to our current vacation in Boston, we took breaks for the bathroom and whatnot. I did something different than last time and had a smoke at almost every stop to regulate my emotions and that helped a ton. I know my family doesn't like that I smoke, I don't really know of a family that would like it. But the constant running around in the bloody heat and doing activities 24/7 makes me more aggravated, which makes me need a smoke. I know that some of that is the addiction. But I'm just trying to act better. I'll worry about the cancer later.  Oh yeah, and food. We keep eating out. I always forget how gigantic the portion sizes in the USA are, and apparently I can't just get some small appetizer because it's not enough food. I mean, that's true, but it's either that or I get a plate the size of my 12 year old sister. Not ideal either way really. And of course I just can't help focusing on my stomach after, it just seems like it's so big and I fucking hate it. Even looking at it now is making me feel like I'm going to cry.  And of course, who can forget the whole ""I can't have an actual break because I'm constantly depressed or stressed over summer vacation and also constantly anxious and stressed because of school""? Yeah, that probably contributes to why I burn out every year. Damn.  TL;DR: I'm a whiny little bitch who can't even go on vacation correctly. Every time I think about this I hate myself more. Why can't I just fucking enjoy myself.",0.40350658971035946,1

American weighing in on the Muppets show here) Except now it's nobody is willing to accept a fuck word from a felt man?

99,"Phone advertisements on certain free apps are horrible. I loathe certain kinds of phone game ads.  The ads are usually fine: showcasing things that happen in the game and such. The annoyance comes from how often I see the ads, but it can also be from something else. I don't know what this is called, but let's just call it ""The Formula"".  Paid games can suffer from this too. Just saying... it's not fun. I am going to use a scenario to play this out.  You just got this new free app about balloons and protecting it (totally not referencing an app which the ads on it are horrible and im using it as an example). After dying two rounds, you encounter an app. A good 80% of the time, the ads will be like this.  At the top, there will be a sentence about passing a level, but sort of in a meme format. ([this ](https://pm1.narvii.com/6862/458e51ad21b501b3fd60c831fee5d7c0fbd4a764r1-960-946v2_hq.jpg)for example)  * Pass level x/Get y points and you're legally skilled * Can they survive x ys? * After x tries, I reached level y!! * Me: (gameplay on one side) My mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend/etc: (gameplay on the other side) Can also be Noob: Pro * Harder than you think * Only x% can get y  This would be fine if it literally wasn't almost every single ad. And to top it off, at the end of the ad, you get three choices with game avatars connected to them. Isn't that just great?!  The worst part is that doing ANYTHING in ANY FREE GAME WITH THIS PROBLEM will most likely cause an ad to appear. This problem has led to certain old apps dying, such as Cut The Rope and Angry Birds 2.  If they \[the producers\] want this amount of ads, they should JUST MAKE THE GAME BE PAID FOR INSTEAD OF FREE. There is even a remove ad feature in most of the games like this, costing the same price as a paid app. Horrible.  I wish it would stop or at least slow down the amount of ads, because this is just ridiculous and annoying. Someone has to make a drinking game out of seeing these ads in 30 minutes (then again, someone would die by the end... uh oh).

We take vacations quarterly and catch the occasional long weekend getaway where we fly Delta since we live in the Atlanta area and they have the best itineraries especially for overseas vacations.

While we are not Delta‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù traveler we would consider ourselves ‚Äòseasoned‚Äô travelers.

After booking comfort plus seats for our trip to Europe this fall we thought we‚Äôd use sky miles to upgrade to Delta One. Which we both have the miles to cover the upgrade. We would also be willing to pay a nominal fee + miles to make the upgrade happen.   According to Delta (In fact their Delta Reserve Credit Card direct line support) we do not have the right class ticket to even qualify for an upgrade.

I was never a straight A student. I was an average student. Average looking, average intelligence. I got bullied in school. I felt into depression and still tried. High school was a mess. I tried my taking my ""cool"" friends advice and ended up dating miserable boys. Grades became worse. I tried hard in sophomore year and got better than average percentage. I applied for colleges all over my country. Got rejected by every single one and ended up getting into a college here in our town. Depression worsened. I got severe anxiety disorders and became extremely paranoid about everything. Then one day, I fell in love. For the first time I acknowledged what it can be like.

114,"About Worrying They  hit you unexpectedly, suddenly, with a force and persistence that  cannot be quantified and is often beyond reasonable limits. They weaken  you, take over the whole of you, make it impossible to focus on anything  because there is always this tiny little voice in the back of your  head, seemingly far away but shouting so loud that it feels like someone  is holding a megaphone right next to your eardrum. Usually they fade  away slowly throughout a day or a couple of days, depending on how much  you hold on to them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is what you do, especially when you are  trying to let go.

Just try to  remember the last time you were love*sick*,  sick being the perfect word to describe the devastating impact of a  simple worry: not being able to eat or sleep or focus for days,  sometimes weeks. Like a virus invading your body, multiplying and  generating an immune response, this infinitely smaller and more abstract  thought generated by your mind, the worry, generates it‚Äôs own physical  response, almost like your immune system sees it as another intruder,  something that shouldn‚Äôt be there and thus tries to burn it out, causing  symptoms similar to those viral or bacterial infections.  &gt;The farmer channels water to his land.   The fletcher whittles his arrows.   And the carpenter turns his wood.   So the wise man directs his mind.   *\~Dhammapada*  It  is always and in any case only the mind that worries. The soul is  incapable of such a complex and futile task and even remains mostly  unaffected. In its essence, the soul *just is* while  for some reason our minds are programmed to try to comprehend this  state of being, question your thoughts and experiences, look back in  melancholic awe or forward in anxious expectance.  Often have I thought that some people‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI like to call them *simple people,* by  which I mean, without condescension, people who do not think so much,  likely because they have a somewhat lesser capacity for complex thought,  lack the proper education or dread picking up a book or having a  meaningful conversation extending beyond the act of practising  procreation or getting hammered on weekends ‚Äîoften have I though that  those people have a much easier life, simply because of the fact that  they seem to worry much less. *Something  doesn‚Äôt go the way I intended it to? Oh well, let‚Äôs go grab a drink and  all will be well. The relationship just broke off? No problem, the next  one is around the corner.* As it so happened, in a few rare moments  during which I managed to share some deeper thoughts with  aforementioned people, I was wrong with my assumption. Quantifying the  amount of worries in the two distinct groups of *simple people* and *the others*  would be an interesting task for psychological research, yet I now  believe there wouldn‚Äôt be a major difference between the two groups, at  least not for quantity. Content is obviously a different story‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthough I  digress from my original subject as this is not intended to be a  comparison between two groups or even a qualification of some people  into *simple* or *others*, but merely a collection of thoughts about the act of worrying.  *The wise man directs his mind*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhy  is it that we allow our minds to make such a big thing out of our  worries, those impeding, overwhelming, crippling thoughts instead of  just accepting them and realising that in our essence we remain  unharmed? Directing your mind sometimes is an impossible task. Once the  seed for a worry has been planted it quickly grows, stands in full bloom  and will only fade naturally. Like a weed when you try to rip it out it  just constantly grows back, emerging seemingly bigger and stronger,  taking up even more space than before.  &gt;What does one do love to empty the mind?   ‚ÄúNothing my dear but sit still and be kind.‚Äù   *\~Keaton Henson, excerpt of the poem¬†Insomnia*  The  thing is, you can‚Äôt do anything. No amount of reason will make those  worries disappear, to the contrary. The more you analyse, the more you  focus on them, the more power you give them. The same happens when you  forcefully try to ignore them. They are there for a reason, even though  you might never know what that reason is. The best you can do is to  acknowledge them without focusing on them, greet them like you would a  stranger on a walk in the countryside and let them walk away, or walk  part of the path with them until both of you part ways. Let them be  present and listen to them if they are talking to you but also let them  go when they are ready to leave. You might be surprised how sometimes  they actually don‚Äôt want to stay over that long in the first place.  &gt;Do you know what it is like,   To lie in bed awake;   With thoughts to haunt   You every night,   Of all your past mistakes.   &gt;   &gt;Knowing sleep will set it right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää   If you were not to wake.   *\~Lang Leav from Sea of Strangers*  *What  I describe in this essay is my way of handling things. Maybe you  strongly disagree or have a better approach. I am happy to hear about it  and discuss it anytime as you and I are both still learning and growing  and will never cease to do so.*  &amp;#x200B;  Originally published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@anxiousblogger/about-worrying-2688e540fb3b)",0.7251411223674781,1

It makes me productive, which is probably why I did this.  Life still feels so bleak though.  So basically I took a vacation to another city. I‚Äôm not sure why. I changed a lot of things recently- switched jobs, moved away, joined clubs, went to events to get out of my shell...and every time I did something, I hoped for life to improve; for me to feel better. But it didn‚Äôt. Instead I got a job I hate, and then I got laid off. I love the new place I‚Äôm in but I hate my new roommate who did some things I don‚Äôt want to talk about on here. The outings just made me feel lonely and gave me a panic attack (I have social anxiety). Etc. etc.  Now I‚Äôm doing this. I‚Äôm hundreds of miles away from anything I‚Äôm familiar with. I had a panic attack on the way here, in public, which was embarrassing as hell. I got to the hotel and blew out so much of my money. I go to my room and feel scared and lonely, but the few ppl in my life I have left didn‚Äôt answer my calls. Then I realize we hardly ever talk at all now. No one cares about me and I‚Äôm not exaggerating- I have no family, only superficial friends, and no one to spend time with.

120,"I need some help. Diet, lack of self esteem, binging, UGH! I am chronically moderately depressed. I am being medicated and in therapy. It isn't helping in my two major life goals: losing weight and cleaning up my near hoarding situation.   I weigh 366 pounds. I have been basically on a carb binge for the past three months, eating bags of Goldfish, packages of Oreos, or boxes of Frosted Flakes most days. I gained 30 pounds, and on Monday was within four pounds of my highest weight. I went back on my diet that day, but I have such an issue sticking with a healthy lifestyle.   The thing is, when my depression gets worse, I stop caring. Getting up early and working out is hard. Planning meals, prepping them, and avoiding temptation is work. When I'm feeling good about myself, I can devote myself to this work. (Literally, before I went off my diet, I was spending six hours on Sunday cooking and cutting vegetables and weighing everything on my kitchen scale.) When I'm not feeling good, it's too much work.   I know nutrition. I know about vegetables, lean protein, limited whole grains and legumes, and even more limited fruit. I know that Goldfish, Oreos, and Frosted Flakes are not part of a well balanced meal plan. But I stop doing it, because when my depression is bad, I just don't feel like it's worth my time to take care of myself.   I've posted this at r/loseit, and no one was very helpful. They basically said, ""You've just got to do it."" (Right up there with, ""Well have you tried being happy,"" that.) I was hoping someone here would have some more useful advice.

If I buy a bag of chips, you open the bag of chips, eat the whole thing until it‚Äôs done. If I bring home leftovers from a restaurant, you will eat every last bit of it and throw the container away.

131,"First Time poster - I want to get the communities opinion. I apologize ahead of time for the lengthy post. I'll try and keep it short. When I was very young my family was mostly whole and happy. I was the youngest of the 6 grand children and an only child. I was spoiled and called the favorite in closed company. We were fairly well off until my mother lost her jobs.   A week before my 10th birthday my mother attempted to over dose. After pumping her stomach and getting her straightened out and she became conscious she proceeded to tell me that she tried to kill herself because of me. I was an independent and strong willed child. She said that I didnt need her anymore so there was no reason for her to be around.  Fast forward nearly two decades on from it and she has tried roughly 12 more times throughout my teens and again about 6 month ago after lying to me and the rest of the family that she had cancer.   I have never known my father or that side of my family. I have met some of them in the past 2 years but they weren't present during my up bringing more so due to my mom than anything else which I also found that out 2 years ago.  My mothers side of the family is the one I grew up with.   That traditional southern patriarchal family. They dont believe that mental health issues exist and go through life pretending as it doesnt while their daughter actively attempts suicide continuously. Their only response or emotional support for me was ever ""take care of your mom."" And I did. My grandma (not blood related) was my only actual parent she was just my moms friend who helped raise me. She was strong sometimes brutal and stalwart. We fought all the time. But when everything was getting worse she could always muscle through it. But she wasn't emotionally supportive and didnt help my mom or me in that respect. Like I said sometimes she was brutal and we fought a lot but she was also kind and giving. After the loss of the spoiled nature I originally grew up with I shouldered the mantle of at home therapist, caregiver, and friend to my mom. Baring the emotional load that the person I consider my grandma simply couldn't take and that my mom couldn't handle herself. As the weight settled with time I got use to it. I always helped and always said yes. Eventually this led to my becoming the care taker to my grifter blood relatives. Never noticing the manipulation because by then I had been taught to always help and take care of my family.   I started working at 16 to help keep the lights on, fix plumbing and cars, pay the mortgage occasionally, and groceries. As by then my moms ECT treatments, twice a week therapy sessions, and two chain smokers puffing away $10-$15 a day had ruined us fiancially. Cant say much though because by then I was already drinking at every opportunity. I drowned my own depression and anxiety and the I guess normal teen issues packed in there with booze. I've struggled with some suicidal thoughts since I was about 14 but I've never considered actually seek out that specifically.  When I turned 18 I became her bank. Loans, credit cards whatever. We needed cars constantly fixed old house with constant maintenance costs. New washer and dryer twice new stove once because everything was always breaking.... As I passed through the teen years I started resenting them a lot. Going to a school that ended up not being accredited when I graduated, working a job that put me in the hospital as my immune system has never been good. The growing resentment made me realise on some level that things were messed up. But never enough to stop helping and being there and doing what I could.   I noticed that my mom always tried to do it whenever she knew she would get caught before it was too late. When my mom tried to kill herself just after my 17th birthday I told her I really didnt care anymore and if I found her again I would let her die before making any calls. She never tried again until about 3 years ago after my grandma passed away from cancer and has tried several times since never being set up to be found by me. Though as resentful as I am against her I could never actually bring myself to let someone die.  As much as I don't want to care and know that our relationship will never actually be mother and son and I cant trust anything she says to me. I still care and I still want the best for her.  I use to just be angry and depressed all the time and just always helping and doing for them.  TODAY I have overcome a lot of internal adversity these last 3 years since I left my whole family behind 2800 miles with my then fiance and now wife to somewhere my skill set has gotten me decent jobs without a degree.  I had a nasty relapse of depression for a few months last year. Nearly gave myself alcohal poisoning one night and havent drank since. Things have been going well first time since childhood that I am not incredibly poor and first time in my adult life that my finances are stable.   The problem is I still occasionally have suicidal thoughts. Though I dont want to die the best way I can explain it is that I want to stop existing. Like be erased as though I were never here. It's only a recent thing that I have figured out that specific desire and that had always been there. I cope with it by forcing myself to do things that I usually find fun. Or go out alone to a mall or somewhere crowded with headphones in and just lose myself in the crowd.  I actively dont put any of this on my wife especially now that her job is incredibly stressful because I dont want pressure on her. I am always supportive and I do chores automatically so there are some benefits I got from being a care taker. I listen to psych books and research a lot and always examine how I am feeling and why. I do a lot of self help. But I am wondering if I should see a professional and get their take.  I'm just not sure. I think my apprehension comes from the fact that I feel like I adapted. I needed it when I was younger and couldn't get it. I do s lot of research myself and I tend to feel like I don't think they can help me. But at the same time I'd value the input of someone who knows more than I do. What do you think?    TLDR: had an emotionally abusive childhood from a parent who couldn't be a parent and a family who either didnt care or werent able to help. I am considering going to see a therapist to get a professional opinion on my mental state but am unsure if I really need to.    ",0.8866101495557198,1
132,"I've crawled out somehow I have suffered with depression for many many years. It has destroyed many relationships, including my marriage. It was like a giant cloud always around my head. I was unable to feel, unable to react, unable to see. I didn't even feel sad most of the time, just there. Breathing. Sleeping. Taking up space. I wanted to die, and tried to a couple of times.

136,"Irked about this customer So I manage my small family business and I'm glad to say we are very busy and doing well. During the lunch hour we are *super packed* and  while we can be considered fast food, if there are 10 people in line and half order food for 3-5 people then it causes a longer wait time since it's not like we can just instantly put together everything. We do handle call in orders for takeout which is usually at least a 15 min wait. During our busiest hour a simple order can expect to have to wait at least a 30 minute wait.  Anyways, so for the last 4 months or so we have had a customer that would always call in for pickup a order for about 4-5 people during our busy lunch hour and show up not even 3 minutes later. He tended to be rude and ask if his order was ready yet, or ask why we are taking so long. Eventually I'd had enough of his entitled ""I need my food immediately!"" attitude when he literally pulled into the parking lot while still on the phone ordering when we had a long line and he was acting annoyed for telling him he was going to have to wait. I responded by telling him that he needed to order at least 15 minutes ahead. So he did start ordering 30-60 minutes in advance finally always mentioning the same specific pickup time. Note: All calls are screened to avoid scam calls plus to obtain the callers # in case of anything. So I started recognizing his #. All was fine until like 3 months ago where he called in a 4-5 person order and didn't pick it up or call in to cancel the order. He then didn't show up for a week or so. Normally if anyone calls and leaves an order they go on the shit list and we don't take their phone orders anymore but this guy I decided to give one more chance. So maybe 3 weeks ago he came in and this douche asked me if I was pregnant. I was super offended because I think that sort of question is not something anyone should be asking anyone they don't know well plus it was coming from a dude which made me super uncomfortable the way he asked and smirked. So that just made me not want to deal with this guy anymore. Well 2 weeks ago he called and said ""hey this is ___ calling in for my usual _____o clock pickup."" And proceeded to order for what I assume was 3 people. So we have the order ready and once again this bastard doesn't pick it up. He went on the shit list because after doing it twice I'm done wasting food for someone that is a risk costing us money. He then didn't call anymore or show up until yesterday(the first time he didn't pick up his order he didn't show up for some days either so by the second time I figure he does that so we forget about his order he left). He called about 3 times but I purposely didn't answer. Didn't think he'd show up. Well around the time he tends to pickup he showed up , placed an order and started asking why nobody would pickup. I told him calmly that his # was flagged and due to not picking up the last order we wouldn't be taking his call ins anymore. He then started saying that someone else must've used his phone to which I responded ""no I know it was you""(not only am I good at recognizing regulars voices but the last time he'd placed the order  he mentioned his usual pickup time which nobody else does) he tried acting shocked and saying that if he did leave an order it was because his job didn't let him have a break. I didn't bother mentioning the first time he left an order but he kept going on an in about how he was sure someone else used his phone. I just listen and hand him his food and before taking off he tried giving me a look as if I was his best friend and asked if I was going to take him off the list. I said sorry but no, those are the rules and because your stuff is made unique i can't even sell it to anyone else so that food goes to waste. Not my fault you have an hour lunch break but feel like your food needs to be ready in less than 3 minutes. Just because your job doesn't let you go on break doesn't mean we deserve to lose time and money. He obviously didn't like my answer because he tried to make me feel bad by saying he'd be going elsewhere for lunch from now on just because he can't call in. *shrug* In all our 10+ years in business my shit list isn't even 30 phone #s long. Also, I did have someone once place a large order by phone and we had it ready. When she finally showed 20 min before close, she said didn't want more than 1/4 of what we had made after all because she didn't need it after all. It was obvious we weren't going to sell the food with 20 minutes left plus it was a lot so I told her if she didn't want to buy the rest, we wouldn't be taking her calls anymore. She ended up not buying all of it so we don't take her calls anymore but she still comes by and didn't try arguing me which I guess is why her instance didn't bother me as much as this guy who felt he should be allowed to call in even though he says his work can make him work through his break at last minute which is why he probably called in and didn't pick it up. It's like if you know you may end up working through break, why don't you pack your own lunch or just not place phone order and be patient. Oh well. That's the end of my rant sorry for weird format am on mobile but yea I can understand emergencies happen and I've had customers call back to let us know they won't be able to pick it up which works because then we can at least try to sell the food if possible. Luckily orders to get left too often or id seriously stop taking them. So at least on the bright side not everyone is an asshole   Edit:  TLDR: guy calls in food order and for second time doesn't pick it up. Food goes to waste and I lose time and money because is very specific/picky order.  He comes in after 2wks asking why I didn't pick up phone. Explain he's on shit list needs to come in now. Claims someone else must've used his phone. Then claims his work didn't let him take break. Asks for me to take him off shit list. I say no. He mad claims he going elsewhere for lunch now. Fine by me, I rather not lost money or time again.   Calling in orders for pickup is a privilege not a right. Business owners/employees, especially small businesses, don't stay in business if they don't make money. So next time you call in and can't pick up your food, especially if it's a lot of food, at least understand why you are put on the shit list without asking to be taken off",0.10667853157280928,0

141,"Ever since 2016 I haven't felt the same The years that have passed since 2016 (beginning of 9th grade), I literally have not felt the same, mentally and physically. In that year I began to hate myself. And every time I made a mistake (even a small one), I would just call myself something along the lines of a dumbass or a retard. I would say it jokingly but I'd actually mean it. Then 2017 (end of 9th &amp; beginning of 10th) I started to worry to much on my weight, and appearance, so I began to ""eat less"" which even though I knew it wouldn't help. And keep in mind that as a guy, when you talk about not liking your body or appearance, people just tell you ""you're a guy, why do you care?"" but that doesn't help. And I ""Ate less"" anyway, that lead to a year of tiredness, even more self-loathing. And now present year 2018, I still hate myself for the same things but In a greater quantity.

142,"I'm not doing so well lately My boyfriend's sister had a beautiful wedding on the 17th and I haven't been right since.   About 2 years ago my mom got married very quickly to a man she met that doesn't like us, her kids (I don't think my mom has every really been with a man that wanted to be a father figure to 4 kids). He has jealousy issues and thinks we're going to take her away from him. Because of that I hardly get to have a nice chat with her on the phone and she lives 8 hours away from me. Our once amazing relationship has dwindled very, very quickly. Especially since the odd time I do get her to talk to me, she has to ask for money. This is my biggest stressor/trigger to my depression. I hate it, I hate how my mom doesn't want to try to keep our relationship. I hate that I don't have someone to talk to about adult things - it sucks.   Anyway, that was the back story. So at the wedding my boyfriend's sister did a beautiful dance with her 5 daughters, instead of the traditional father-daughter dance (their parents have passed away), and it had her invite each daughter individually, do a little dance, then invite the next daughter. It was very cute and I couldn't help but cry. When my mom got ""married"", I found out the day of as I just happened to call her while they were at the court office, after 2 months into their relationship.   So since my mommy issues started 2 years ago, I find I keep discovering more reasons that my mom hasn't been a good mom, and it kills me. For example, my mom (when she used to sell vehicles) sold me a car that I have today that has high payments, high interest, and put me in a lot of debt. I bought the car because I thought it was doing her a favor. It turns out that the finance department, who didn't like my mom, fucked me on the financing. As a naive young adult, I didn't know better but now I can't get a loan for school or anything so as a trying-to-function adult, I'm struggling very hard. On top of that, my mom has chronic pain and depression/anxiety (like mother, like daughter), so while I'm trying to calm the immense anger that I have towards my mother I also worry excessively the same about her. I don't know how she's doing, or if she's taking care of herself/being taken care of. And I feel guilty.   So I'm struggling. I take anti-anxiety meds (sertraline) but I feel them ineffective since the wedding. I want to seek professional help, and ultimately get off the meds, but I don't know where to start.   If you made it this far, thanks for reading. There isn't much that one can provide advise on, and that's fine. Have a good day!  &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR - I've been depressed since my boyfriend's sister's wedding because she involved her kids. My mom got married 2 years ago and basically dropped our relationship into the ground and I have unresolved issues surrounding that.

Right now, I have no job and I spend my days doing absolutely nothing. I do look for jobs, but that's about all I do. I feel so depressed that it's hard to even clean the house, and that just makes me feel so much more useless. Even my boyfriend's mother has said that it wouldn't be so bad if I did something, but I don't even clean.  I have a lot of creativity in my mind, and I wish I could write, draw or make music.. but I can't. I'm too much of a perfectionist, and whenever I try to do anything creative I just lose all hope because it makes me feel like even more of a failure. I honestly don't know what to do with my life.  I wish there was something I could do to be useful, but I'm a burden even to people who love me. There's no one I can talk to, since I only have one person I truly trust and he is already stressed enough. Everytime I talk to him about my problems he gets depressed too, and since he is my boyfriend, I can't stand seeing him hurt because of me.  Basically all I do is eat (barely), sleep (too much), and sit around doing nothing. I don't listen to music anymore, because I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't watch movies or youtube, I don't read, I don't do anything, because nothing makes me happy. All I can think about is how useless and worthless I am and it's honestly destroying me inside. The worst thing is that people are also telling me I'm useless and not doing anything. I know I am, and they act like I don't know, they keep telling me how terrible I am for not cooking and cleaning and working like a normal person, for not actively seeking out friends. I know I'm not doing those things. And I don't know anymore how to live like that.  I used to be that person, I had a bunch of friends and I partied a bit, I had a clean apartment and I cooked food regularly, and I was a promising student in college, even getting a stipend. I feel bad about that too, since the stipend went to a person who ended up not even graduating. I was literally about to graduate, but I ended up having a massive depressive episode for months and fucked up my life forever.. and people keep reminding me how bad I fucked up. How it's my fault I didn't graduate, because I was too depressed to even get out of bed. It's my fault I moved away from my abusive family and cut ties to those who were able to financially help me when I was in trouble. And my life is just a constant goddamn reminder of how bad of a timing my depression had and how it's my goddamn fault apparently that it happened. And I know it shouldn't be my fault, but apparently it is. All I get is judgement and at this point I'm tired of trying to fight for myself, because even trying to say it wasn't my fault results in more judgement.  I still have regular nightmares of mom starving me because I was fat, of her taking away my medicines if I told her I feel depressed, of her manipulating me and even hitting me sometimes if I bothered her too much. I'm traumatised, tired, and I've never really had a home or parents who loved me. Now I'm too old for that, and all I have is a bunch of problems and mental illnesses.

Now i've had to battle not the cancer but getting even a fucken CT Scan. Its a huge fucken battle just to get care. I am so tired of that. Mentally speaking of course depression and anxiety and probably some level of autism. Sure ive seen the medical people and the counselor people, i almost finished a masters degree in that subject. I think its clear that i am failing in life due to medical issues as much as mental issues but no one offers me any hope at getting better at that.  Suicidal ideation really only lasts a few minutes, i know that, ive seen the research the problem is that its constant. Its always in the back of my mind. My previous counselor, a great women the best ive ever had really, did make me promise her i wouldnt kill myself and while its been months since ive been able to talk to her i do try to keep that in mind. All of that being said just because i dont try to kill myself doesnt mean i wont die. Clearly this kind of stress and worry is hazardous to my health and will kill me sooner. So sadly no amount of promising can change that.   I will add that even calling suicide hotlines has been useless. I have gotten some of the stupidest, rudest, least prepared people ever. I have to call non stop, to 3 or 4 different lines and by the time i try to dial the 5 i just give up on getting help. Clearly i dont have luck in getting the support and help i need. I wish someone would actually take me seriously, actually care for me and actually go the distance. I think i try hard but no one thinks its hard enough for them to make the effort it seems.   I dont think anyone believes me when i say that few people out there have fought as much as i have just to stay afloat and yet there is no out there to threw me a life preserve. Its a constant state of sink or swim and people just attribute to a lack of trying or some kind of malignant lack of interest. I think what i say is obviously not a faithful representation of how i fight. IT must be that i dont speak clearly and that i dont show my work i guess. I think just being alive should be enough to take me seriously.  In the end im not sure what anyone can do for me, but someone to give me a huge irl. Someone that would be genuinely interested in me, in getting to know me and maybe even loving me unconditionally. I dont think i have that and get it loving me is no easy task. If am the kind of person that will bite you if you pet me but clearly i need that love.   So there is no solution or problem really to be fixed directly but i can just hope to make it one more day but the question reminds what happens then. This will keep happening until something out of my control changes or until i die. Clearly neither is a good idea",0.7660123143733557,1

165,"Finally giving depressed girlfriend the break she wanted My girlfriend of two years began her depressive episode 3 weeks ago. Over the course of which she 180d from a girl who was head over heels and wanting to marry me to feeling like our relationship is hopeless. I have a previous post going more in detail if youre interested, but in order to make her feel in control and give her some space, i decided to give her a week of space with little to no contact so she truly gets the isolation she wants, however this morning, the second day into this break, she got rear ended. She posted a pic of herself with a caption of the situation, and in the past of our relationship she has posted snaps specifically for me to see. I guess my point to this post is should I continue to give her the space? She would‚Äôve reached out if she wanted me right? Or do i still show i care and ask her nonetheless how she feels. What should I do?   Update: She posts on twitter often because she feels that she doesnt bother anyone there.

166,"I'm 18(F) and I have nothing to live for Recently I let my entire life fall apart. I lost my job, dropped out of university, wrecked my relationship, lost almost all of my friendships, and can't afford to pay board so I'll probably get kicked out of home soon. (Before I start this I'll just clarify I have dealt with mental illness my entire life and have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety for  long time) This year started so well. I had everything I wanted; a great job, amazing friends, and I was getting straight a's.  I went to South Korea in April and had the most incredible trip. About a week after getting back I found out I'd missed an exam worth 30% of my grade (for the record I had approval from the lecturer to go, and they had told me I wouldn't be missing anything). Pretty soon afterwards I attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital. Less than a week after getting out I tried again but didn't succeed (obviously). During the mid year break I stopped working. I told myself and everybody I was sick and the doctor said I had glandular fever but looking back I think I could have forced myself to work anyway. I stopped getting out of bed and spent everyday watching TV at my boyfriends place while he was at work. When university started again I didn't attend any classes because I had convinced myself I wasn't going to pass the class or graduate because of the test I missed. I continued to not go outside everyday and this caused my social anxiety to flare up and now I have a panic attack every time I leave the house. I've also stopped putting effort into my appearance and one of my boyfriends friends called me ugly when I went to the movies with him recently, along with another stranger, who shouted it at me. This really upset and shocked me because I've done a fair bit of modeling and have never heard this from someone who isn't me before. I've become really irritable and have started picking fights with my boyfriend and now he wants to break up with my because he can't stand my arguing. I know this is all my fault. I don't want to lose him. I love him so much and I would do anything for him. I can't stop thinking about suicide. I don't see a reason to live anymore. I don't want to live.",0.8570468285506815,1
167,"Something To Help You Guys Out Hey everyone.. sounds very condescending but genuinely hope you are all doing well in whatever areas of your life be it mentally, physically, financially etc.  So I (20M) have struggled with depression for more than half my life.. won‚Äôt get into the details because this is a post that maybe will help some of you out. Recently I have been seeing a therapist and spent the first session just going over my life and at the end of the session I was prompted to write out a timeline to produce for next week‚Äôs session (which is this week). Doing this felt like a godsend because oftentimes when you‚Äôre wallowing in your mind, you may think about events but they‚Äôre all pretty scattered and don‚Äôt follow a chronological order. I honestly recommend that you write a timeline in any form you want (I did it as a journal) from the time you were born and just go year by year (or by age.. whichever). You can choose to share it or keep it to yourself, but I think this may help some people.  This week‚Äôs session, my therapist used the analogy of a bucket in the sense that everyone has one and in our buckets are just a shit load of things like social factors, personal stuff etc etc and when our buckets overflow, how we act is a representation of this (e.g. isolation, low mood). However, these buckets have taps that are our coping mechanisms: hobbies and the sort. You should draw a bucket and put all the stuff in there that contributes to how you feel etc and what your taps are; could make things a lot clearer for progression in the future.",0.8781409604390636,1

174,"Quitting antidepressants after ~15 years To make a long story short, I‚Äôve been on various antidepressants throughout the years: Prozac, Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa... most recently I was on Effexor XR. It was a godsend at the time I found it. It took me from being lifeless and hopelessly depressed to feeling ok and motivated to do more with my life. I finally finished college, lost weight, and then moved abroad to teach English. I‚Äôm now in SE Asia teaching and living my dreams.  The only thing making me feel bad lately is my antidepressant. It seems like that‚Äôs my style with them. I do well, then slowly the efficacy drops and the side effects increase. The Effexor‚Äôs side effects had slowly started creeping up on me... first was the increased sweating. I put up with that even though it embarrassed me. Then came the decreased libido. I literally had no sex drive which is unfortunate as a now 30-year old male. Finally, and this was the last straw, was the emotional dulling. I was effectively an emotionless, blah, sexless, sweaty robot.  Rather than switch to another antidepressant, something which is near impossible to do with such limited resources in Asia, I decided I‚Äôd had enough. I was tired of feeling so blah when I should be excited to finally be living my dreams. I dropped the dose of my Effexor to the lowest available dose (75 mg) and added a bit of Prozac to help my body adjust when I stopped taking the Effexor. Yesterday I took my last 20mg pill of Prozac.  Honestly, I feel pretty ok so far. The only thing is that I feel a little wobbly for lack of a better word. Sort of like my brain is scattered and I‚Äôm in a bit of a haze. Sometimes I have to sit down and really force myself to focus for a bit. I feel a bit manic and scattered, but I haven‚Äôt felt any real depression.

188,"Yes, Kathy, I'm so much less financially responsible than you because I bought chocolate hummus. So, long story short, I was spending the day with someone I consider to be my second mother. We stopped at a farmer's market first, and while we were there, we saw one of those bike bars that like 20 people can ride. She says casually, ""(husband) and I were looking at buying one of those."" I thought ""uh, okay, I can't see how that kind of an expense would benefit you at all"" but I just nodded and went about looking at the stands. Later on, we went to the grocery store to pick up some things and I found some brownie flavored hummus, which I LOVE and hadn't been able to find in my city until then. I was really excited and decided to buy it for a whopping $4.50. My second mom looks at me, scoffs, and says ""LF, that's way too expensive. I \*personally\* can't throw money away like that, but you do you.""  I'm just fucking irritated by it. She always acts like living frugally is something that was forced upon her instead of HER CHOICE to stop working while her husband brings home an income. Now, my family is and was very well off for as long as I've known her, but that's because my dad works six days a week running a business and my mom works full-time as well. It's not like I'm just some snotty rich girl who expects people to serve me mimosas while I bathe in rosewater. What I had in financial stability growing up, I lost in time with my parents and extracurricular activities that other kids could do, LIKE HER KIDS. My parents wouldn't have ever had the time to drive me 45 minutes both ways to be in the town orchestra LIKE HER KIDS WERE. I was a latchkey kid who had to entertain myself. My parents didn't have one-eighth of the time she had to embark on creative projects with her kids. She even make a comment to one of her kids in front of me that I grew up ""ritzy"" because I like Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Come on, fucking really? My family might be ritzy, but we didn't go on a real vacation until I was seventeen and it was sponsored by my dad's business that he worked tirelessly to build. So get the fuck off your pity train. You could have had everything I have and you chose not to because you wanted a different life, and that's \*fine\*. But it doesn't make you better than me.

The first time I talked to someone about it was in high school. I‚Äôve seen many many many therapists and psychiatrists. I‚Äôve been to support groups and read books. Here are my issues with finding help:  Over the years whether I had health insurance or not it‚Äôs been tough to find someone who accepts my insurance or to find a provider I can afford out of pocket.  Even if you do find someone, your availability can be an issue.  On top of that you have to actually call and follow up. Which I never want to do in the first place!! This part has been annoying because some of the staff members at these offices are rude. How do these people not care that the person calling is sensitive and they are looking for help? Or that their job is customer service. Wtf.   I‚Äôve started from scratch so many times and I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to be getting out of therapy. Psychiatrists are prescribing me the wrong combination of meds and my therapists aren‚Äôt getting me to open up. I‚Äôm paying a copay to tell them about my day at work.

193,"My BDD has ruined my life and any chance of happiness. Worst part is, it‚Äôs not totally in my head and I really don‚Äôt see it ever getting better... I can‚Äôt even share my secrets with my fianc√©.. *Before I start, my disorder is REAL. I am not vain or just insecure. I can‚Äôt help my obsessions they literally control my mind.. So please, no comments unless they can be truly helpful or you can relate. I pretty much break down to any mean criticism (part of my BDD)*   Hello! I‚Äôm a 25 year old female who has struggled with BDD and anxiety my whole life. In case you aren‚Äôt sure what BDD is, it is body dysmorphic disorder. I MUST obsess over at least one physical flaw at all times, sometimes more than one but usually one will dominate until I find a new obsession/fix the flaw. It‚Äôs not just a simple ‚ÄúI hate this.‚Äù It‚Äôs staring in the mirror for hours. Looking up solution after solution to ‚Äúfix‚Äù yourself. Thinking about the flaw pretty much 24 hours. Not being able to sleep because it consumes your thoughts. I see myself as someone who looks like no one. I am a monster in my eyes.   My first obsession was was my skin. I hated it. I was constantly called Casper as a kid. I started laying in the sun for hours and using self tan at the age of 12.   Next, I started wearing makeup when I was only 11. This was kinda due to having an older friend who showed me it and then my mom encouraging me to wear it. My mom is also so hard on herself. She obsesses over her physical appearance as well. I think she wanted me to wear makeup because we are blonde with light eyebrows and eyelashes. I think she thought it helped make my features look better. The blush hid my pale skin and the lipgloss added some more color to me. I was really the only 11 year old in full makeup everyday. And by 12 I never let anyone see me without it. To this day I‚Äôve never been totally bare faced around anyone....  Then it was my body. I was too skinny. I wanted a womanly body. I started downing bulking shakes at 12. I eventually got a breast augmentation last year. And now totally regret it... part of my BDD is to never be satisfied. That is why plastic surgeons should genuinely evaluate the mental health of their patients. People with BDD are not recommended for surgery. But I did it anyway because your obsessions tell you Your BDD isn‚Äôt real and your a disgusting monster that needs to be fixed.   Then it was my hair. Part of BDD is doing impulsive things to your body which is what I did all throughout high school but the first time I did it was is middle school... that is cut my own hair. I would literally take chunks out of my hair because I thought I was making it look ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù And then look like a crazy person after bc I obviously have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Before prom, I cut my hair so badly I had to get extensions. I also would dye it so often that it was a fried mess. I finally was able to control this obsession somewhat by not cutting or dying for the last 2 years and I finally like my hair. (Even though I‚Äôm scared one day it will fall out or it‚Äôs still too thin... I know, crazy!!)  Then it was acne... oh the skin picking I did!! It was insane. The hours I spent before school to cover it... finally going on accutane was great. But I still suffer from very very minor hormonal breakouts and again, obsess when it comes about. Sometimes not even leaving my house over one pimple because to me it‚Äôs disgusting.... the weird part is I don‚Äôt even notice flaws in other people. I just can‚Äôt stop obsessing over my own! When my fianc√© has a spot or a friend has a lot of spots, I literally don‚Äôt notice at all...   The latest thing I‚Äôve done was microblading and eyelash enhancement... oh why I didn‚Äôt realize that I would become obsessed with the results!! They honestly look good to everyone else. No one has noticed. But to me it‚Äôs uneven and not the right color, etc etc... you probably have to be eye to eye with me to see anything wrong with it. But then my BDD says ‚Äúwhat if all your hair falls out and then everyone will see the way you botched your face!‚Äù If something isn‚Äôt 100% perfect, it‚Äôs a nightmare for me... and the fact this is kinda permanent was horrible for my obsessions.  And the WEIRDEST part of all... when I‚Äôm dolled up, people tell me I could be a model. I constantly get hit on. I have a ton of Instagram followers and my fianc√© is probably the most gorgeous man I‚Äôve ever seen... but to me I feel like I‚Äôm the grotesque monster who must camouflage herself daily to look presentable to the world. I walk with my head down everywhere I go. I never notice people flirting with me or anything because I think everyone can see how gross I am. I have NO self esteem and NEVER act like I‚Äôm ‚Äúhot stuff‚Äù even if others tell me I am because I genuinely DONT believe them...  I‚Äôm just so overwhelmed. I‚Äôm always drowning in thoughts. It makes me so depressed. I just want to wake up and feel happy... I don‚Äôt think my BDD will ever truly be gone...  This was more of a vent than anything. But if anyone can relate? That would be amazing. I feel so alone in this and the BDD thread is pretty much dead..",0.6972163270443835,1

I didn't want to go back there for my Masters so I applied for a new city for my Masters  - Exercise. Started running and couldn't do much. Eventually built it up to 30 minute runs, and I do them twice a day. One in morning and one at night. They make me feel good afterwards and put my thoughts into perspective  - Loving kindness meditation. Started to practice self compassion and compassion for others. This made me feel good. On top of this I started to have positive affirmations too  - Supplements. I supplement Vitamin D, Zinc and Magnesium. This helped a bit too  - CBT. I don't have a therapist for this I just do it on myself. I catch my negative thoughts and challenge them. This helps put into perspective how the emotional mind is manipulative and deceptive.  - Massively cut back on the alcohol  - Only hung out with friends who I knew were my true friends  Now my Anhedonia is gone. I enjoy things again. I'm discovering myself... I laugh and have joy.  Its. Not all perfect though. I still seem to have anxiety, so while I've beaten depression I still have underlying anxiety.

Last summer (at the start of the academic year) my house was raided because it turned out my dad was  a fucking pedophile, and it got all over the fucking news. Shortly after my knee was destroyed in a sports accident which not only destroyed any hopes of my lifes dream of getting into the military (something which i've dreamed of, without any family/parental pressure, in fact in SPITE of, since i was about 5) and also robbed me of all my hobbies (which were, for the most part, sports based). And you know what? I worked bloody hard despite the crippling depression which overcame me and no one supported me through (because, all my friends had been second year and by this point had gone to uni, yay me!) and even so, i managed to get into Oxford University. Even so, i didn't brag, i didn't even want to talk about it. On results day i just wanted to check that my mates were okay and that they'd done alright.     And now, they just fucking hate me. These are people that i helped, tirelessly through our courses. Never pressuring them, but always there when they asked (any they always asked). And now i find out that all summer they've been excluding me from their fun, they've been bitching about me and all sorts. I went out on a night out with them tonight, and they treated me like shit. And you know what, fucking fuck them. I was a good person, i never asked anything for helping them and i've had to deal with their shit for god knows how long. i really loved these people, all i wanted is for them to succeed and now they're bitter because i actually did.     They treat me like success just fell into my fucking lap and it fucking didn't. Even tonight, when THEY invited me out, and they were just flat out insulting me, they couldn't target anything i'd fucking done. They just leveled insults like ""pretensions"" and ""narcissistic"" at me. Well fucking fuck them! I'm neither of those things, and none of them can actually say how i am that way. It just upsets me know that people that i've tried so hard to help, that i've expended so much effort over treat me like utter shit. Just because they failed.      Well fuck all of you, i've defriended you on facebook, i've de-whatevered you on instagram and i'll never speak to you again.

218,"Treated like I know nothing by the people who ask me for advice and need my help I work as an equipment specialist in a popular outdoor retail chain, basically means I‚Äôm not quite management but also much more trained and more responsibility than a sales assistant, I know my shit and I run my own floor dealing with all types of equipment from rucksacks to footwear and when I‚Äôm not working in the store I‚Äôm normally out climbing, running, or mountaineering! Most of the time I have decent people who understand that I know my shit and listen to me but then I have way too many occasions like today where I‚Äôve had a woman come in because she‚Äôs wrecked the ultra light trail running shoes that she bought 4 months ago and has worn everyday since to do everything from gardening to walking the dog, even in snow!! I remember this woman when she originally came in because she‚Äôd told me that‚Äôs what she‚Äôd wanted to do but completely ignored every piece of advice and recommendations I gave her and decided to go with these completely unsuitable footwear because she liked the colour!! Of course she proceeds to scream and rant about going to trading standards because they simply weren‚Äôt good enough for the price as if it‚Äôs my fault she wrecked them and that I personally should talk to the manufacturer, a very widely known massive company, and get them made better. At this point I‚Äôm seething but still having to smile so I call my manager up and I explain the situation to him and she proceeds to tell him ‚Äòthis kid you‚Äôve got behind the till is trying to tell me I‚Äôve been using shoes wrong for the 40 years longer I‚Äôve been on this Earth than him‚Äô (side note: I‚Äôm actually 21).

So my manager decides we can do an exchange for her as a goodwill gesture, firstly she picks exactly the same ones as she‚Äôs just wrecked again so ultimately this will happen again, but then my manager asks to see the receipt so he can do it, which she doesn‚Äôt have. So ok we can do it off a bank statement which she says she has but when we ask to see that she says ‚Äòoh of course I haven‚Äôt got it with me, but I‚Äôve written it down‚Äô and proceeds to hand us a hand written post it with the date of purchase and how much she paid and her signature (as if that means anything to us?) so at this point we‚Äôre at wits end but still having to be polite and she just continues to be aggressive when we‚Äôre doing what we can and her stupid friend she‚Äôs brought with her for support is just stood there rolling her eyes whenever we say anything! At this point we ring customer service and they agree to just do the exchange to get rid of her so we do it for her and she continues being aggressive because we had to ask for her address, like is always necessary for faulties in case they need to contact them for more info, and then finally when she leaves, starts shouting about how I know nothing and I‚Äôm a stupid kid who‚Äôs trying to bullshit her even though she‚Äôs older!

People who buy turtles and other more exotic animals from an outside place and then go to the pet store and expect the employees to know every detail about that animals' care are irresponsible pet owners. A store employee isn't an expert unless they tell you they are and if they are claiming to be an expert, be suspicious. It's possible to have a lot of information about an animal but not all the information about every animal. Before you bring an animal into your home as a pet, find out what food and habitat requirements it has on your own. Don't expect that the person who sold it to you was an expert either. Learn about your pet and what it needs and don't grill store employees that didn't sell you the animal about everything it might need. If an employee is dishonest, they'll convince you to buy stuff you don't need and you'll be wasting your money. At the very least, if you are going to own a turtle, learn quick that they can't be put in regular tap water. Tap water has chlorine which can cause harm to your pet.

Finally I landed at one job which turned into abusive enviroment which I had to suffer for next 5 years. Never mind, its done and dusted.

I was made homeless for 3 months whilst still working, I was forced to sleep at someones sofa. Then I found a bedsit with a size of bathroom, never mind though, everybody got their up and downs.

I met old people who think that their ancient mentality or their decreased cognitive ability is an excuse for doing whatever they please, or acting as much of an annoyance that they want because ""I'm an old person, show me mercy"". Fine, some days I can tolerate it and can brush it off becuase that person is old and it is wise to treat them with respect but there come those days where I really want to tell them to either fuck off or cut out all of that bullshit ... But if I say something I would be deemed as someone who disrespects old people  I also met women (mostly women. Some men did the same thing but I mostly encountered women who did this) who often acted like bullies and think that their bullshit is justified becuase ""I'm a woman. You should treat me with respect"". Fine, everyone has their own problems and I understand have to go through  lot, from the menstrual cycles affecting their moods, social standards of women, catcalling and so on. I get it and I can tolerate it some days. But I would not call you a woman if you keep behaving as if your toxic behaviour is justified. That's not being a woman. That's called being a bitch .... But if I say anything, I would be deemed as a misogynist   I even met both children and parents who think that they can do whatever they want becuase they find it hard (although it is more difficult to communicate with children/teenagers becuase they are often more egocentric, have limited autonomy and do not think like an adult). Fine, parenting is hard and tiring and I know that some parents are a pain in the ass too. But that does not mean that you are either justified to act like an asshole and ruin other people's day just becuase yours is not good, or you have every right to attack me becuase you think you know best becusse I think that how you treat your children or your parents is not wise (some parents did this a lot especially when I tell them that their behaviour is not healthy for the child but they sometimes acted like they are all -wise experts/know-it-alls if someone acted differently). I don't care that you are having a very hard time.

For example, we all have a room with a desk in it to do our homework. My roommate decides that's good enough for him. Instead, he decides to take up the whole dining room table with his computer and books and whatever else. The dining room has no barrier, and it is right next to the living room. We have a TV. I told him straight up that I liked watching TV downstairs over the summer, so he might have to studying in his room sometimes. He hates the noise. He responses with ""I can't. I don't like it.

My anxiety didn't agree, this was so perfect I subconsciously did not believe it and had a huge panic attack. I had built up many walls from the past and did not let them down in due time. My anxiety caused me to desexualize her and I knew logically I had made a terrible mistake. This could have been easily avoided but I failed to do so.

235,"School uniforms are the epitome of double standards. Alright, time to fucking get this off my chest, this is a grudge I have harboured since I fucking started Secondary school. School uniforms govern what boys can wear way fucking more than they do for girls, and boys have far less freedom about what they can and cannot do about it.  For instance, last year the girls in my school were feeling fucked off that they couldn't wear ties, so they decided to keep wearing ties, and then the school decided to accommodate for this and even got the female students a specific type of shirt to wear to go with the tie. Male students, however, are forced to wear their ties no matter what, which annoys a lot of them greatly, and when they take them off, they're sent immediately to isolation. And when a bunch of male students decided to go without their ties, the school doubled the fuck down and even started making more and more teachers patrol the halls in order to curb their freedom.  It goes deeper, girls are allowed to wear skirts, whereas boys aren't allowed shorts, are allowed earrings and jewellery whilst boys aren't, and are of course allowed makeup.

A: No  A: I didn't give her shit  M: So you're giving me 25% because YOU made her cry  A: No  A: Because you brought her paper  M: What  A: I'm impressed with your commitment  A: On bringing the paper  M: Bitch I (for the most part) keep my promises  But him? not so much.

243,"Encountered the worst professor I've seen in a long time Let me start by saying that I spent two years in community college and I just transferred to a university this semester. I was indecisive this summer so I ended up enrolling in classes pretty late. Regardless, I was feeling optimistic about it.   First week was going relatively well until I went to the first day of my Calculus class. I've heard that the professor for this class wasn't the best, but time was ticking and I didn't have any alternatives. Despite that, I wasn't prepared for just how much bullshit I was getting into.   This class is apparently supposed to meet once the first week and then twice a week afterwards, which I double checked when I registered. Professor comes in late, walks up to the computer at the front of the class and pops in a CD. She doesn't even talk about any sort of syllabus, just pulls up a powerpoint equivalent of the textbook and starts reading off the slides. Actually just reads it. Maybe draws one graph here and there, but never explains a single step.  Every now and then she stops and make us do an example of the problems she didn't explain, so I (and I'm sure at least half of the class) pretended that I had a clue of what was going on and just scribbled on paper for a minute. She kept calling on people to answer the examples which wouldn't be so bad if we weren't so lost. I noticed a few people were just getting up and leaving, and I wanted to leave but I didn't want to interrupt by getting up (I was near the front of the class) so I thought to endure it for the rest of the hour. But ten minutes in I couldn't take it anymore.  At one point she called up a student to solve a problem on the board. The guy was trying but she kept pointing out mistakes and, ""Why did you solve it like that?"" While the rest of the class was just sitting there in absolute silence. It was excruciating. That was when I decided to just go the fuck home and abort this entire course.  I felt like I was back in high school, hell even middle school with the mediocrity of her lecture. She even called out people on their phones as if her lecture was anything worth paying attention to.   I'm pretty sure I was in shock as well. I just got up and left. I've been fuming over it since. An actual (expensive) calculus class from an actual university, and this professor is what they have to show for it. They interviewed and hired this professor.

After a huge amount of reflection, I realized it was time to put the pride down and go see a doctor about mental health. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression. Doc gave me Paxil for daily and Vistaril for when shit gets bad.  After ~9 months of reflection and self improvement, I ran into the ex. We talked and decided to see if we can fix our problems. At first it was awesome! like a second honeymoon. But there's a reason you dont date an ex. After 3 months of off/on I came to the realization that the extreme anxiety she gives me isnt healthy. I did stuff to make myself a better person....and she really hadn't. I broke it off. Told her for both of our sake, I wont contact her anymore. She agreed to do the same.  4 months later, I was getting better. The anxiety and panic attacks were backing off. I started trying to lose weight, eat better, leave the house more. I was almost to the point where I would be ok to date again.....Then i found out last friday she's getting remarried. We were still ""together"" in March! What the actual fuck!  I have slept maybe 2 hours a night since. No matter what I do, I cant get her out of my head. I am freaking out. I couldnt breathe.

256,"Government workers abusing their power with immigrants So I have been friends with this person for almost seven years, we went to high school together and now he and I are roommates along with two of our other friends (because life is expensive). I have always known that he and his family weren't legal citizens, but it wasn't until yesterday that I realized just how horrible the process of surviving in this country without citizenship is. We all know the recent events with trump being elected and all of the immigration issues, but what we don't see as American citizens is how this is actually effecting the immigrants in their everyday life. My friends and I ride four hours with our roommate for him to have his DACA renewed, and on the way there I discussed with him the process. If they miss their appointment for any reason, even a terrible emergency, they can not reschedule and there is a high chance that they can be immediately detained and deported. Not only that, but when they are in that office, they are not allowed to have any electronic devices on them, to ensure that the process can not be recorded. Why, you may ask? Well, probably because of they way they are treated inside those walls. My friend told me after he came out of the appointment that he witnessed a man and his wife sitting in the waiting room with their baby, waiting for their appointment, and the baby became unsettled and started to cry. They were threatened by the workers that if they didn't quite the baby, they would be forcibly removed from the building and not allowed to return to renew their paperwork until the next four years were up. The people tried to calm their baby but he was just very upset, the workers began to harass the man and woman and when the man attempted to tell the workers that they were being unfair, they threw them out. These people are now unable to renew their paperwork and are therefore at risk for being detained and deported at any time. If you're wondering what could happen to the baby, just do a little research into the recent discovery of what are more or less child concentration camps for immigrant children. Sad part is my friend was talked to in a  disrespectful way as well, he is going to college six hours away from his family and didn't have the original letter sent out that he needed to come get his paperwork renewed. When he was asked for the letter and explained he didn't have it due to his circunstances, the woman said to him ""well if you really cared about being in this country you would have found a way to get it. The woman who was handling his paperwork was African American which made this even more shocking. This whole process is not only humiliating, but completly inhuman, these people are not allowed to fight back or speak up for themselves without the risk of being thrown out of the country like they are no more than a bag of trash.

Just the way the ruling class likes it.    **1.) ECONOMICS-** People subject themselves to menial 9-to-5 jobs just to get by.  We work more for much less in hopes that one day we'll make it and be able to afford our dreams.  Wages have remained stagnant, the cost of living has gone up, everything is expensive, and good paying jobs require you to bootlick and bootstrap just to have a shot at landing a damn interview.

I don't understand why this left vs. right paradigm bullshit is so hard for people to wake up from. It's not rocket science, it's just divisive.    **3.) TAXES-** Another serious thing that irks me.  People are so proud to give up more than half of their earnings (it may as well be more than half) to keep this nonsense propped up. ""I'm a responsible taxpayer"".  No, you're a slave.  Do you even know where most of your money is going? Cause it damn sure isn't going towards infrastructure.  More than half of your tax dollars are going towards keeping the global war machine well-oiled and funded.  The rest is going into the pockets of corporations and politicians.  But the war machine never stops.  It probably costs someone's yearly salary to produce a single missile that's going to level some damn rubble somewhere in the middle east.  Of course though, people pick and choose what they want to be outraged about.  ""Well, as long as those immigrants/commies are out and my wall is funded...."".  But mention one thing about the destruction and havoc we cause on a daily basis on the other side of the globe or our absurd defense budget, and suddenly no one has anything to say.   I've only ranted about 3 things, I was gonna do more, but now I've made myself angry and I don't feel like typing anymore. With that being said, 1 or more of these things will happen:   1.) Someone is gonna get upset because I've insulted their hamster wheel way of life.  2.) Someone is still gonna call me a liberal or a conservative despite the fact that I've made my position very clear on the matter.  3.) Someone is gonna give me an apathetic response about how as long as they pay their taxes, there's nothing else they can do/It's not their problem.  4.) Someone is gonna give me a rose-tinted response that invalidates what I've just said to restore their bubble of ignorance.",0.22021769779196307,0

275,"I want to talk about ghosting    I was thinking about posting this to Facebook but then thought I might not want everyone I know reading this.  We all know what ghosting is but here's what I consider it. When somebody tries to reach out to you and you consciously make the decision not to acknowledge their attempts to reach out to you. You literally see the texts it missed calls and make a conscious decision not to follow up, hoping that they'll just ""get the hint"" and leave you alone.  I think this is rude as hell and do not do this to people. People do this all the time in the dating world, to their so called friends, and even to their own family.  If somebody is trying to date you or pursue you romantically, at least give them a fair chance. I mean it could be something great and you'll never know unless you give it a real, fair honest chance. Somebody sees something special in you so if you gave it a shot, you might also see something special in them. But if it's just not gonna happen, you should give that person some sort of closure by telling them, ""sorry but I'm no longer/not interested. Best of luck to you in finding somebody."" Or ""Sorry but there's somebody else who I'm seeing/talking to right now so I can't date you. Hope you understand. Best of luck to you.""  It might feel mean to have to say that to somebody but it's not mean. What is mean is to pretend they don't exist and leave them feeling sad, angry, and confused.  Or when a friend of yours reaches out to you and asks to get together and you're not feeling it. Just tell them you're not feeling up to it today. Tell them you're tired or too busy or already made plans. If you just don't reply, it leaves that person feeling really crappy about themselves. You don't want your friend to sit there wondering why nobody will even acknowledge their existence, do you?  But above all, if you are a parent and you are doing this to your own son or daughter, then you need to take a big step back and reevaluate your whole life and your priorities. If your own son or daughter is not important to you...so unimportant that you are making a concious effort to ignore all it their attempts to reach out to you...then what the hell is important to you? Where there hell are your priorities at? How could anyone be this way???  &amp;#x200B;  Yeah, I get the hint! You're an asshole!",0.4448103521431613,0

279,"After years of issues I've just been diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia. Here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.    I hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. Some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. I think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. Hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. Here's what helped me:  Stop drinking completely. You may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. Alcohol is of course, a depressant. Giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in Western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. Alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. Try going at least a month without drinking. I expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. I don't know much about those though.  Exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. The endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. If you join a club you'll make some good friends too. Personally I think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. Group classes are good though. Track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. Go out even if it's raining. Once you've warmed up it's great.  Give yourself a project or ambition to work on. Immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. You might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. Or it could be something totally new. Some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, CAD. I hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which I don't think helps much. I think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. Just pick something to work on and do it regularly. Share what you do with other people.  Minimise your social media use. There have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. Dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. I'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. Same goes for reddit. Try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.  Find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. Therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. Good friends are better imo. Maybe some of them are having problems too. You could help them and feel good about it.  Get some quality sleep. Go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. If you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. There's a ton of stuff like that on Spotify. You'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. There's also Sleep Radio. Also important is getting out of bed on time. Have a little routine. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing Feeling Good and don't give a shit who hears.  Recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. This is hard. Sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. Don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. Get up and do something. Do that thing you've been putting off doing. Clean the kitchen. If you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.  Avoid shift work. It's really not good for you.  Get a pet. Or even just a plant. Look after it well.  Listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. If you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.  Spend more time around nature.  Help other people with their problems. It's rewarding.  This last one is going to be very controversial: Make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. Hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. Say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. I'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours.",0.7715737770158785,1

If somebody is accused of murder and is put on trial, the people commenting on it will act as if the defendant has already been found guilty, and has definitely done it. When Morgan Freeman was accused of sexual harassment, back when there was only one article about it done by one reporter, people were acting like he definitely did it and that it's time to stop supporting him, despite there being no evidence past the one article and no trial.  It just really pisses me off how people read the headline 'X accused of doing Y' and instantly assume that X definitely did it, that they're guilty as all hell, and that a simple accusation means somebody did something.",0.23995882842902566,0

My friend, let‚Äôs call her G, began to hang out with this group of ‚Äúwannabe‚Äù stoners who would smoke and do drugs on the weekend. G had never hung out with them before this, so me and my other friends were very concerned.  One day, we were in another town over for a band event. G had said that her friends were going to be coming, let‚Äôs call them K and T. I never really cared for either of them because I found them both rude and disrespectful  right off the bat.  The two of the show up and go inside. Meanwhile my friends and I had gotten lunch. We come back and G tells me to park by T‚Äôs car, because he drove to the event.  His car is very messy, and old. G says that we should all throw out garbage in his car, telling us that he never locks it and it would be a ‚Äúfun prank.‚Äù  I immediately say no, and throw my trash out in the nearest garbage can.  G does it anyways, throwing all her trash on his already dirty floors. Fast forward an hour, I am walking outside with my friends and I see T throwing all the garbage onto my car. ALL OF IT!  I am furious, I run and scream at him. Why did he do that! I‚Äôm telling him I didn‚Äôt put it in his car but he is too high or just dumb to realize it.  I expect G to back me up and tell him that it was all her, but no she just decides to get high with them .  Flash forward today I now have class with all of them and another one of my friends called N. Now I‚Äôve known N since freshman year, all seniors now, which is longer than all the others. I expect her to be on my side. No, she isn‚Äôt she doesn‚Äôt believe me when I tell her my side of the story, even though I have 4 reliable witness to back me up.  So we are in class and the teacher passes out papers. T is giving them to our table, and oops there are none left for me.  ‚ÄúSorry you don‚Äôt get one, remember that time you left trash in my car?‚Äù I am furious again, I tell him that I never put garbage in his car and he had no right to throw it all over mine. He says something along the lines of that it‚Äôs my parents car. It is 100% my car, not my mother or fathers. He then asks me the price.  What on earth does the price of my car have to do with the fact that I confronted you on why you threw trash all over my car? Can you not handle that the real truth of what happened that day came out?  Why are u dodging the truth?

307,"The Unintended Harm of Invalidation - Shouting ""You Are Loved!"" at people who don't feel that way means we fail to listen to how they actually feel. I know there are people on here who mean well.  They really do, they want everyone to feel loved, cared for, like they are SOMEONE, that they matter.  But I don't know you, internet stranger.  Do I feel loved?  I don't.  Not because I have noone around, but because my brain is preventing me from feeling like I am lovable.  It tells me you will be better off without me, that I am a sad burden who is no fun, has little to no redeeming qualities, and of course you are going to say that you love me and that you wish I was better, because you are hardly going to sit there and say the opposite.  In order for me to heal, it's important that I don't feel as though my point of view is invalid.  'What you believe is true' is never truer than for someone trapped in a depressed mind.  ‚Äã  The following is an excerpt from a news article posted in the NZ Herald about suicide rates. [You can read it here.](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=12115601)  NZ has by far the highest youth suicide rate in the developed world.  The year ending June 2018 saw the highest number of suicides across the countries population since records began, which was also the second highest per capita in the developed world.  It's an epidemic.  *'People who have reached the point where they are considering ending their own lives are convinced EVERYONE would be better off without them. Their friends, their family, even their partners and children.*  *Ultimately, they often believe they are doing those close to them a favour. The feelings are so intense that reason can't get through. The best case is they may think you're trying to help. Worst case: they may think you don't get it, and stop talking.*  *It's also true that it's a guilt trip. The person who is on the brink is already crippled by guilt and shame, and lumping even a small amount more on top won't help: it may in fact cause harm.*  *I've talked a lot in my columns about validation, and the unintended harm invalidation can do. Shouting you are loved at people who don't feel that way, means we fail to listen to how they actually feel.*  *You can't force people to feel loved.*  *But to risk truly validating, to risk daring to try and understand why someone may wish to die is terrifying - and it's never been more necessary, at an individual and a national level.*  *We can't just talk about love and caring for each other. We have to enact it: support, listen and accept our loved one's point of view, even if that means tolerating listening to them talking about their wish to die.*  *Stay close. Walk by them. And give them every support they need.'*  ‚Äã  I really have no idea what the point of this post is, but I see a lot of 'you are loved' posts popping up.  Personally, for me, it does not help.  It makes me feel more isolated, because you don't know me. AT.  ALL.  You are loved... in what way?  Tell me how you love me, stranger who has never seen or heard me?  Tell me why the people in my life love me, because I can't see if even when THEY say it.  I almost feel patronised by it.  I don't know, maybe I'm ranting.

While I agree many works of art hold a deeper message, it carries on to us as social creatures. This class acts like everything HAS to have a hidden message and that so long as you can back up your ideas, the answer is not wrong. How this places into social life is that it makes us think everything we do in life then has a message attached to it. Why can't we just do something because we like doing it? Wearing a pink backpack doesn't mean I am fighting for the cause of breast cancer... it just means I like the color pink and I chose to get it.    I hate English 102 because this is a core class in the first year of college. It has made me fearful of the things I do because it further enforces the idea that everything we do is sending a message to others.",0.4790766188818353,0
323,"I hate my dad Im 18 yo Male Asian  Let me start this off by saying that i respect my father he's an immigrant coming to the having to get settled to a new life. I am grateful for everything he's done provided me with a home, and food to fill my stomach but, i would be lying if i said he wasnt a shit person.  He's single handedly ruined my life. I don't have any fond memories of him it's all terrible but, there's one memory of him that i hate the most and for some reason i can remember it like it was yesterday. I was probably around 5 and i was with my younger brother 3 yo we were standing up for some reason watching pbs kids minding our own business. Until my mom comes running to the door with my dad running after her with a knife he gets there before she can open the door with the knife pressed onto her neck she's crying trying to pull away his arm and he's just keeping her in place with the knife on her neck.   While this is happening me and my brother are crying pulling on my father's shirt trying to pull him away with no success this lasted for what seemed like 10 minutes until he let go and walked away only to scream and belittle her. I remember my mom just trying to comfort us giving me a bottle of milk (wasn't breastfed) and we just went about are day. At the time i didn't realize how much it impacted me until later on when my mom said that the reason i stutter is because that event traumatized me. I wasn't born with a stutter i just though i got it overtime and that i was just unlucky. This made me hate my father more because even with my stutter im very social i try my best and even though i get hurt and embarrassed when i get made fun of i still try but i would definitely be lying if i said i didn't mind my stutter. Stuttering has had a huge impact on my life and that's another story for a different time.  My dad also likes to gaslight i remember as a kid me and my brother doing our homework with my father watching us beating and yelling at us but yet he disregards this ever happening. I've never seen him talk in a normal tone he's always yelling and even today everytime he comes home he's just yelling at the top of his lung and is always mad for no reason. He screams at my youngest brother ( 6th grade ) like he's dying i swear i can walk across the street and still hear him yelling. He was physically and mentally abusive to me my younger and older brother and my mother. I should clarify that now i have 2 more younger brothers and 1 younger sister. He's only mentally abusive to them because im able to protect them physically.  He's the stereotypical asian father when it comes to school yet whenever i do anything worth praise he doesn't care, he's never participated and helped in any of my schooling yet he feels the need to have an opinion he did not register me he doesn't drive me to school and events he doesn't do anything and, yet he has the audacity to get mad over the smallest things. My graduation was something that i thought i would get some appreciation for seeing how i am the first one in the family to graduate (older brother dropped out) he could of said good job and it would of been enough but instead he belittles me in the car then he gets mad he's yelling in the car. At the graduation he just has this angry look like me graduating is a problem. On the way back home he continues his rant on how im worthless and that im a piece of shit for not being valedictorian.  The biggest thing that pisses him off though is when i tell him what i wanna be a chef. I know that being a chef is hard but its not something that i just picked up a few years ago, i remember as a kid telling my mom that i wanna be a chef and i've stuck to that belief. Anyways whenever i tell him his rage just goes out the roof he tells me that im not his son, that im worthless, that its a waste of time he doesnt wanna talk to me and to make it worse when he leaves he puts his anger on my mother. At this moment i'm honestly lost idk what i wanna do anymore i really don't and i'm honestly scared not of him but of my future. If i go to college it wont be for me and it wont be for culinary. I wanna be happy doing my job my father is just trying to live his life through mines.  I love my mother with all my heart shes not like my father in actuality shes the polar opposite shes quite and a loving person i just feel so bad that shes married to such a monster. She's even told me that when she only had my older brother she filed for a divorce but it didn't go through because my father didn't sign it. I wish only for the best of my mothers shes cared for me 100x more than my father ever will.  My father also like to play the ""farther"" card saying hes bought me everything that this is his house and hes not wrong but at the same time it holds no merit because my family is poor. We are in between the middle class and poverty leaning more to middle class. That normally wouldn't be an issue but we have 8 people living in such a small house in a ghetto neighborhood. I have a bed with pee and shit stains the ceiling and walls are cracking and the cloth i wear is the same cloth i've had ever since sophomore year thank god i did not grow that much. The shower has a huge whole underneath the shower head showing all the pipes and don't even get me with the amount of water that comes out of said shower head .Like i said before i'm grateful for everything but when he uses that statement it holds less value than if some other father said it.  My father is also a total bitch someone was stealing our stuff from the garage and my father saw it but he didnt do anything it only stopped because me and my older brother caught the person and took him down.  sry for the long rant i just despise my father  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",0.4170780400519718,0

325,"Just a rant on my family and sex and stuffs.    Okay into the really long  rant. Vulgarness warning.  So i became sexually active junior year of high school. It started on my 17 th birthday when I planned to suck my friends dick he cancelled for reasons I don't remember. I ended up telling another boy about my cancelled plans and he was like ""well you can do me?"" And I didn't really like that boy, like I HATED him. We were NOT friends. but he insisted. So I got away with just kissing him that day. He was my second kiss ever :( so a few weeks later somehow he coerced me into giving him a blow job at school and that's how that started. That went on for like 6 months Max (like once a month, not too often) . I never told anyone about that bc my mom was adamant about purity and absensence.  Fast forward to the first time I'd had sex. Summer after graduation, I was talking to this guy who was actually a total dick Hindsight. We were never official but had been talking for maybe 3 weeks. During the second week, he started asking for sexual favors and I was like ""nah. I'm not about that anymore."" He kept fucking asking tho. And it was over text so yeah I was being pressured but it wasn't real pressure bc he was no where near me to ""pressure"" me. So he planned a super romantic date where I think he was planning on fucking me and I mean I was falling hard and had developed a que sera additude about him and all his promises to make me feel good. I asked if I could see him the day before our date and we fooled around in my car. WELL that day, a friend of his police dad said he'd seen us somewhere we weren't supposed to be and the boy in big trouble at home. Thanks was when he decided he shouldn't see me anymore but texted and  asked one more time if we could have sex. I wouldn't have said yes but my parents were arguing at that exact moment and I was so angry. So I let my daddy issues take ahold of me and found my way to his house and got a mediocre fucking :////  The second boy I fucked was a weird freak that insisted on asking every girl he met if she was a ""Dom or sub"". We took interest in each other. He kept implying that he wanted to have sex with me whenever we hung out and do eventually I just let it happen :( that happened so many times.  The next boy was a rando; that happened twice.  The next boy was a tinder date. The next boy was a boyfriend which is where the problem started. Up til this boyfriend, I'd been in college and recovering birth control every three months but due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to take the semester off to work. At work, I met him.  He was this... Backtown hick, really sweet, really country, not very smart (he put a video on YouTube of him doing a trust fall off a roof and breaking his back) , I thought he was so cool. (I really liked him but I later found out that everyone at work thought he was a huge dick. I still don't see it but I do see how his nonchalant ""I don't care about anyone or anything attitude"" could seem dickish, especially because of how it ended)  We hadn't had sex for like a month. In fact I have told anyone about him for like a month bc I was 18 and he was 22 and my family would say ""he is a MAN. you are a GIRL. You know what he wants"" and that's eventually exactly what they said when they found out. They did not like us together. They did not like him. I had only had one boyfriend before him, in high school. They hadn't met him. But they met this guy and hated him and his being. I told my family that I had been in his house and they hated that too. So my next obvious move was to lie about where I was. I told them I went to see the Black Pants movie and MY BIG MISTAKE WAS THAT IT HASN'T COME OUT YET goodness fuck I'm so fucking dumb. I shouldn't have lied right, all we did was watch a movie at his place. We really didn't fuck that night. We hadn't fucked at all yet. But once it all came out and went to shit I got angry again and we did it.   Poor choices on my end I know. Then when that relationship was over, I began an new one with my current boyfriend. Since I had such an awful backlash with my family from the last time, I decided to be open and honest. I spend the weekend with him for the first time after 3 months and when my grandmother asked where I was going to be that weekend, I told her the truth and she and my mother were so angry. They, meaning my grandma and my mother, always say ""I don't know what you were doing in college but you've changed! I can tell! We can all tell your not a virgin..""  It just feels like there isMy grandmother asked me if I was sexually active. I said no, which was a lie. A few months later, she told me she already knew bc she knows what the ""discreet"" packaging on birth control looks like. Why the actual fuck did she ask???   That's one of my main complaints right now. I know I'm at fault for a few of the things in the following rant but all my lies are because my family is SO fucking judgemental. And I try my best not to let the judgement phase me but it just DOES. ITS EASY NOT TO LET RANDOM STRANGERS AND FRIENDS NOT JUDGE ME BC I DONT SEE THOSE PEOPLE EVERY DAY. *I SEE MY FAMILY EVERY. FUCKING. DAY.*  no way to win work my family. And I admit I made a few bad choices about sex. I wish they would butt out completely!! I'm 19 and paying my way through my life already!!

This guy at my work is moving and he's a great guy, definitely friends with him and would love to have a couple drinks tonight and send him off. But why the fuck did we pick a place on the complete opposite side of the city? No one lives over there, not even this guy. So why??? He sits near me and I have heard him mention that a bunch of people aren't going because it's far. Well no shit. No one drives to work here because parking is as much as a rent payment. And it is too far to walk. ANDDDD it is in an area that would take you an hour to get to by train at rush hour. So we all have to get into Uber's.... also at rush hour in downtown traffic. It will take 20 minutes at least even by car because it can become grid lock around here with so many pedestrians crossing all the time.      I just don't understand. We are in a nice part of the downtown area with HUNDREDS of options within 1 or 2 blocks. Every single person would come for at least a little bit if we went across the street. I really wanted to go to this thing when I was first invited, but the location wasn't added until today. So now I feel terrible for accepting the invite and not going. Still haven't fully decided yet but I am leaning towards not because I don't want to be getting home at fuckin 9. ""Oh thats not late"" ""Just come for a little bit"" .... It is late to me because I have a life and responsibilities outside of work and have shit to do before bed. And I would go for a ""little bit"" if that little bit wasn't going to be shorter than the god damn commute back and forth. I can throw a rock from my office and hit a dozen bars.

Stucked in a shitty job after spending years of disciplined study, cannot quit because of money, little saving, no properties (including house or car), living in a failed country with low opportunities, only have 2 family members, few friends, stucked in this useless job that take me 10+ hours day (including commute) that I hate and not learn anything from and suck me every energies of my body.

No, I'm not self-loathing, it's more like a disappointment when you see how something could get much better but it didn't, and it won't happen anytime soon.  Lots of thai people complain about this too but we can't do anything.  I was born in Thailand, living there until 18 and moved to England. There's a lot of differences and the similarities, I wouldn't say that it is objectively better there from my birthplace; It just comes to me that a lot of 'good quality' about Thai culture is also the one that brings it downhill today.  We're just so damn fucking lazy and unmotivated as a culture. You know the whole 'land of smiles' thing, this appeals a lot to tourists coming to Thailand and thai people themselves; it comes with a cost.  The extremely laid-back and lenient attitude means people don't take anything seriously, law is not really enforced and rampant crimes, people just living day by day with no future plans or goal providing they've got something to eat and sleep.   In Thailand we have this nasty kind of nationalism. Many like to pretend everything is perfect and censor criticism to the country. Anything who tried to prove any constructive criticism without being called a traitor. Traditional art, music and literature is untouchable, it is a sacred thing to be worshipped only and any attempts to take its elements and mixed with contemporary culture is a blasphemy that's hugely frowned upon by censorship people there. (Even if majority like it)  Our literature circle is severely underdeveloped because of censorship and 'morality standards'. So it end up that people won't talk about heavy topics and most of the things that sell is some bad slapstick comedy.  There was a celebrity who complained about how bad public transportation is and got a Twitter brigade about how unpatriotic she is.  Don't let me get into politics, endless cycles of military coup who blamed that the elected government is corrupt and unrighteous, which ended up in elite-serving junta rules that are more corrupt and oblivious than 'flawed' democratic ones. Gap between rich and poor and patronage work culture and little upwards mobility for people who tried hard.  Then there's Lese Majeste issues, I'm mostly fine with the Royal Family except how there's no discussion beyond praise-only policy, or else you end up in prison, if not, royalists will give you know what lynch mob on their own.  It's fairly modernised in how comfortable to live here now if you've got some money, but we're 'culturally' lacking in innovation, education and values to be proud of. This is not a 'western worship' thing either. China, Japan and Korea have their long track of history and we just.. yeah.  Many rich people in Thailand are of Chinese descent because they work hard and value intelligence. (Tbh, I don't like western/eastern dichotomy. It promotes too much us vs. them.)  **A lot of westerners keep saying that third-world countries were hold back by colony past to be developed.

We (all of us are teenagers) are expected to run the store open to close with absolutely no word from out boss or manager every day.

I‚Äôve been talking to this girl I met online for about 9 years now, she‚Äôs my best friend, we know everything about each other  and oh my lord I love her so much and she feels the same way but she lives on the other side of the world so rip I guess. A while ago I reconnected with an old friend, we both ended up admitting we liked each other in high school and ever since spending time with each other we found out those feelings are still there  and since then sparks went flying ,but the amount of chances I got to kiss her and become more intimate got killed with the thought of not wanting to fuck up a friendship since a relationship is out of the question. since she‚Äôs only here for the summer and is going back to her home country next week. We even went on a fad date to see how it would be and it was amazing.  Another girl I liked after like a year of having no chemistry with anyone, yeah my friend screwed that up for me. Not going into details but let‚Äôs just say he‚Äôs a jackass. Before all of this even happened the first girl I ever went out with, she was amazing and we where a perfect match. I only ended up going out with for two days because well what do you know, when I went to tell my best friend at the time about her, I find out hes had a crush on her for years and it was hurting his feelings and so I backed off. Only to talk to her last night after years and years of no contact to her asking me why I broke it off with her to me admitting it. Only to find out that she rejected him way before she even met me because they went on a date and afterwards he told the entire fucking city that she slept with him when she didn‚Äôt. I am so tired of all this shit and never even getting a chance to be happy with someone because of such stupid little hiccups , I want to cry , but I haven‚Äôt cried in years and I try to force out a tear to just try to get some emotion out but I just can‚Äôt it feels like shit. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing here on a brand new account even though I can write it in my main and everyone will see, I usually don‚Äôt care and am an open book but right now I just feel so pathetic.

374,"Hello. Long read and it kids confusing. I posted it to technology but I need more karma All I want to know is how they were doing and it and how to know if someone‚Äôs still doing it.  I know it sounds crazy. Hello ( Sorry this is a long read and it was done on an iPhone) I don‚Äôt really know what to say but here it goes. When I went to high school I would make jokes about shooting the school up a couple of times.( I know I get it shit thing to do, tbf I have ocd and a lot of other ‚Äúproblems‚Äù but I would never want to harm others.) When I was 16 I dropped out of high school but while I was just getting high a home I told one kid to tell other kids to look up my search history( tbf I didn‚Äôt think he would actually tell kids but he did and they did) they sent my search history though the whole school and kids started to live stream it on Instagram and put it on Snapchat. they seen a lot of weird stuff I was watching on porn and a lot of war videos. I would run my mouth a lot and talk shit to the kids which some found funny and kinda like me.they would also just sit and watch and wait to take pictures though my phone camera and would record me saying weird things I would openly admit to. I knew all I had to do was download a vpn which I did but It made some things unavailable on my phone so I deleted it.( I don‚Äôt know why I just didn‚Äôt keep it or just redownload it) Fast forward a couple of months and we moved out of that house and were having a hard time finding a new house so we moved to different hotels for awhile.( the one kid A knows how the internet works so he could still watch my phone without it being on WiFi I think, which he did as I was living in hotels) this kid let‚Äôs call him A( I went to school with him since 1 grade maybe longer I don‚Äôt know who he is exactly to this day but he said I did go to school with him since we were kids. Now a little back story I want to a k-8 grade school until 5th leaving and switching to different schools though out Orlando. The k-8 th is literally right next to the high school I went to. When we finally moved in to a new house kids started coming back and watching with the excuse that they liked me because how I talked and would act and joke around to my friends on Xbox.( as a kid my dad gave me acid a couple of time which they knew because I was having a lot of issues in my life which the kids would sit and listens to) I don‚Äôt know exactly how it was at the school but some kids liked me and others talked trash of course. Some of my ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù went to different schools one lives in another city and I know of at least maybe 5 high schools that knew of me(idk how many schools knew of me. I heard people from my dads job were listening even my cousins middle school knew of me, I have cousins in Palau listening, tbf the kids would go on Facebook and find out my family and family friends and talk shit about me.). 3 of them in different city‚Äôs 2 in Miami and one in Clermont, this is gonna sound crazy but kids went in To xxxtentacion livestreams and talked about me and he even started doing it( watching my phone) I don‚Äôt what they where doing to do it or how but they were. The kid A would talk to my mom on the phone about what kids were saying and what I was doing, this one girl who I also went to school with was watching and was like really breaking everything down like some type of therapist, also taking to my mom on the phone. A girl that was dating my moms roommate when I was 13 kinda had feelings for me even years after moving out and was also watching and xxx was talking to her on instagram so he could get a better understanding of What was going on. I watched a lot of porn and war videos which kids liked for some odd reason( I‚Äôm BI so the girls kinda liked that and I guess the guys liked the war videos). I really wanted to go to Syria, I wanted to join the YPG but when I sent an email kids did to talking about me so I never got an email back. I know this a bunch of clutter but I honestly forgot about it. It kinda stopped about 2 months ago if I can remember correctly. A lot of it is a blur and seems so unreal. I just kinda wanted to know how they did this and vent a little. At first kid A had my address and was able to use that to get my IP I think but he has a computer set up so he could do a lot more. I honestly would forget about it almost everyday when I wake up it‚Äôs like I would think about other things in life but I would go in my moms room and talk with her and it would click on my head what was going on. Like 2 of my friends would listen and watch my phone while I played Xbox live with them and I totally would forget that they could and were.( they would laugh at something  on the mic as I watch things on my phone and sometimes I would say‚Äù are you guys watching my shit‚Äù to be funny and they were) I Smoked weed a lot from 15 to 17 slowly down because I lived in hotels and would get paranoid. I‚Äôve really taken a break since moving in this house and I stopped as of late. I took acid on a beach trip with my friend a month ago and since this all has been coming back to me. I don‚Äôt know if it was the acid or just me taking a break from smoking weed or what but I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it since.",0.4358897800097973,0
375,"Why I can‚Äôt get over her My girlfriend and I broke up about two months ago. It was her decision and all of my fault for not thinking anything through before I go ahead with it. These things aren‚Äôt too serious but they are in the category of making and following through with plans. Looking from the outside in with our relationship one would question a lot of the things I did that made her angry and the things she said after the fact. All of that in mind I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty with all of the stuff I have done and I am completely responsible for the downfall of our relationship. I ruined one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. 2 years I had the chance to wake up and fix myself but I didn‚Äôt. I was selfish, inattentive to her needs, and worst of all lazy.   I had two chances to fix myself when we broke up but all of that went to waste. I don‚Äôt blame anyone for telling me to move on but I can‚Äôt right now. Despite my shortcomings I loved her and helped her through the worst period in her life. When all of those things happened I was right by her side no matter what. I loved her personality, her past, her aspirations, and her flaws most of all. I was never one to send surprises but I was one to sacrifice almost everything to make sure she was okay. I know I have to give up my love for her some day but for now i‚Äôll hold onto it and treasure it. I hope all of you that read this take the time to treasure the people that you have fallen in love with.   We often take for granted what we have become accustomed to and when it is gone it may very well be our downfall.

A couple months ago when I got into some trouble with my living situation. she said that she had a extra room because she sleeps in the living room. She said she would help us out and not charge us so we can get back up on our feet (after I offered money for each month were there) .. Well a month in while I was at the hospital with my mom, her having surgery she texted me and was real rude. (She expected me to keep her kids that day and didn't ask me if I had anything to do or if I would do it.) Anyways she got pissy because she had to take her kids to their dads and she texted and said she needed a sitter for that whole week. I told her I couldn't because I had my own appointments to keep and she said I guess Im just f'd then and was just rude. I ignored her text for a while and she ended up texting a few hours later saying because I won't watch her kids I have to pay her 300 $ a month to live here. I said ok.  No problem. Long ass story short I ended up getting suckered into watching her 2 kids for 20$ each day which is from the time the babies wake to sleep. They see her 1 time a week. They even get confused and call me mama.  Its sad. After this about 3 weeks later she says she needs 100$ more from me over the 300$ on the lease agreement I said no because that's not the arrangement she signed. I mean I already eat the cost for pull ups eating out etc for her kids so I don't feel like I should. She wastes her money on stuff for her. Then after I told her no she said she could only pay me 100 a week I was making 120 weekly. And its just a whole lot of her messing with me and going insane showing her ass. What reAlly pissed me off is I came home tonight to her ex husband going off on me because the dishes weren't done (im the only person outta 3 people that cleans  she's nasty) he was saying that I need to help her more and I used her and run all over her. Its the other way around. But his drunk ass was being aggressive and I was about to lose my shit. He demanded that I lock our mama cat her kittens (6 total) in my room while he stays the night which is abuse to them.

400,"Antidepressants: Change in personality and cause of breakup? Reddit, please please please help me understand. Can someone in this thread please read this and help me try to understand this person and what happened. I am currently more heartbroken than I feel like I've ever been about somebody in my life, as I'm writing this I feel absolutely sick to my stomach and sometimes even feel suicidal with how unbearable this particular heartbreak feels for some reason. I was dating this girl (we are both females) for 6 months, and our connection and level of chemistry and interest in each other was unprecedented. To paint a picture of how things were as I first got to know her: she pursued me heavily in the beginning (first 5 months), cared a great deal about my emotions, invested a lot of her time, was incredibly selfless, claimed to be ""whipped"" all the time, told me I was a long term investment and that she couldn't wait to ""lock it down"" with me once I moved to her city (we were long distance). Our communication was very healthy, I felt heard and understood by her no matter what. Every concern of mine, she wanted to know and would be very reassuring and validating of my emotions. On top of that, our chemistry for each other was ridiculous, we couldn't even be in the same vicinity without wanting to tear each other's clothes off. She had a secret crush on me for years before we began talking to each other like this because we were both dating different people, but always told me (and still does) how I was her dream girl and she would always wish she could date me or someone like me.   &amp;#x200B;  After the 5 month mark, she randomly went off her prozac medication cold turkey for 3 weeks. During those 3 weeks, her personality began to change rapidly. She went from being the most level headed, emotionally mature, happy, level, selfless person I've literally ever met, to being incredibly irritable, unreasonable, manipulative, defensive, childishly selfish, toxic, vacillating heavily, moody, impossible to please (don't do THIS - now do it exactly how I said not to, repeat) and above all apathetic and unempathetic. It's like out of nowhere she has no emotions. We've talked openly about this and she agrees that she is apathetic and has no emotions but feels very comfortable in that, and claims it's just a part of who she is. Out of nowhere she said she doesn't know what she wants and can't be in a relationship any time soon because she knows she's not capable of being what I need and wants to preserve what we have. She went back on the meds about 2 months ago now but these behaviors remain the same. In addition to that, she went from being a self proclaimed anti social hermit to being very social, hanging out with this particular group of coworkers non stop and claims to be very happy with her job and her life now - which she hated before. I'm very happy that she finally loves her job (it's a very good job) and that she's finally being social and loving life. But it hurts me so bad that while I'm over here in pain daily about losing her, she's perfectly content with her life and doesn't seem to have any worries.   &amp;#x200B;  NOW about these coworkers......I asked her if she has been talking to anyone besides me and she admitted she was talking to her coworker who is MARRIED AND STRAIGHT and 10 years older than her. She admitted to having a flirtatious relationship with this person where they lightly joke about liking each other but she has developed an actual interest in this person and realized that she can be interested in more than 1 person at a time. Before, we used to talk about how neither of us understood people who weren't monogamous and could be interested in multiple people at once. Hearing that she's talking to and flirting with someone else shattered me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, even though I get the sense that its EXTREMELY casual and she swears I'm way over thinking it and it's not as serious as I'm perceiving. She says that she doesn't have feelings for this person at all like she does for me, but that she kind of likes what she has with this coworker simply because it really is just that casual. She still claims that her feelings for me have not diminished at all since the very beginning and that she wants to essentially save me for later in her life when she's at her ""peak"" and can handle a serious realtishionship with me because she knows we would be amazing together. She said she really didn't want to let me go, but when I heard about her being interested in and talking to other people I immediately told her we should cut contact. She was angry at first and argued with me not wanting to do it, but then was very understanding and agreed to it.   &amp;#x200B;  Reddit, I am so sick with heartbreak. I don't think I've ever felt so intensely heartbroken before. I not only feel as if I'm mourning the death of a person I once knew who doesn't seem to exist anymore, but the pain of this same person who I feel so intensely for just easily moving on and distracting herself with another woman kills me. I actually have physical body pain in my chest, heart and stomach from how much this hurts and it's to the point where it's making me feel suicidal at times. The thing I'm having the most difficult time with is accepting and rationalizing how this all went so south so fast out of nowhere. She's constantly vascilting and giving me different reasons for how things happened and can't seem to give me any concise overall answer, contradicting herself all the time, giving me different reasons with every talk we have. After talking about this 4 or 5 times now in length with her about the reason behind why this happened, the overall theme that she always seems to come back to is that she does have strong feelings for me but doesn't want to destroy something really special and good because the way she is right now would destroy us if we tried a serious relationship and that she just needs time to focus on herself and work on herself before she tries that with me.   &amp;#x200B;  But to me personally, I cannot shake the idea that this extreme change in her values and personality happened because she stopped her prozac cold turkey for 3 weeks, then went right back on it without tapering. I've brought this up to her in the beginning, but she is very indifferent about that and claims that the medication has nothing to do with it. She refuses to acknowledge that her messing around with her meds correlates to the exact same time frame her personality and values changed. Can anyone in this thread please help me understand this? I've never experienced my own personality or values shifting SO drastically like this so I'm having a hard time not blaming myself for not being good enough for her.   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: I wad dating the woman of my dreams who went off her meds cold turkey, then back on and everything fell apart within that same time frame.

404,"BYE GRANDMA! (No TL;DR) Just some context otherwise this story isn‚Äôt going to make sense. Basically my family comes from a small village in North India (yes they have water, toilet paper, a normal house, cars, electricity, and WiFi there). I‚Äôm related to my cousins there from my dad‚Äôs side, and this grandmother of theirs is from their mom‚Äôs side. So I‚Äôm not related to her.  This grandmother is the biggest headache in the entire family. Our family was having problems with conceiving children before my cousins were born. Before they were all born, the women in our family consulted the family priest (keep in mind that this is a small village, lol) who suggested practicing cleanliness and prayers and everything before they attempt to conceive.  My aunts went all out. No meat in the house, no alcohol in the house, no garlic, onions, spices, or anything. They ate the plainest food all the time to practice being plain. At home prayers were arranged to be done twice a day and that side of our family started extreme community service. Six months later, my younger aunt became pregnant and had her first daughter.  My cousin was the first girl to be born in that family after like three generations. So everyone was really happy. In this village it‚Äôs considered bad luck if generations of a family don‚Äôt have a daughter because then it means that the Goddess doesn‚Äôt live in their house since girls are considered the form of the Goddess in our village.  My aunts and uncles basically did what families do and offer things for free to the poor. My older aunt decided that she wanted to adopt and did all these things that my younger aunt did in hopes of adopting a good daughter, which is how my second cousin came into the family. However, their grandmother wasn‚Äôt happy. I shit you not she said, ‚ÄúAll this work for a girl?‚Äù  My family would do this every time. And every single time a girl would come or be adopted and this grandmother was not happy. She ended up in the hospital because she said that they have only girls! People were so offended because of how she was acting.  Nowadays my cousins are older than me, and this grandmother doesn‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre all educated and doing good things in their lives. She‚Äôs just concerned about them getting married. She ended up in the hospital three days ago because my oldest cousin said she wasn‚Äôt interested in marriage and this grandmother asked my aunts and uncles how they can live with an unmarried daughter.  My aunts requested the village council to move this grandmother because she‚Äôs so ungrateful and sexist but this grandmother says that if they send her to an old age home then she‚Äôll eat poison, die, and curse generations of our family.  I‚Äôm honestly so done and we keep getting phone calls everyday because of this shitty grandmother that I‚Äôm not even related to. My actual grandparents stopped visiting her long ago because she‚Äôs insane. However, she won‚Äôt stop crying in the village and spreading rumors about my girl cousins and how she wish they had a son. Every single time a couple in the village have a daughter she doesn‚Äôt even go to visit them! Um‚Ä¶ huh? But then during Navaratri (nine nights of the goddess), Diwali (festival of lights), and some other village events when girls don‚Äôt come to their house to be worshipped she gets so offended.   Everyone in our village is tired of this lady and I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre gonna try to move her out no matter what she says. I‚Äôm so fucking done with this sexist bitch.

410,"A failed friend and A failed father's story, looking for advice. (sorry for formating, don't normally post) For as long as I can remember, I've always had depression (which isn't saying much, as my memory has become terrible) this all changed when I found out that me and my ex fianc√© were expecting a child. The moment I got the news my mood shifted, the negative shadow at the back of my mind became silent and I was happy, I was happy for just over 9months and I continued to be so for a good year following my sons birth. And then it came back but this time much worse, maybe because I had what I perceived as genuine bliss to reference what happiness felt like.  This is where the title comes in, because I was depressed, I began to struggle connecting to my son and maintaining the connection with his mum. Eventually it all fell apart, I was a separated dad with anxiety and depression who incapable of emotionally supporting his son. I began questioning his mums ability to take care for him, and even tried to keep him (maybe in some twisted attempt to make myself feel I was the better parent, to give me the boost needed to not feel like a failure) in the end, after about 4 hours I changed my mind I couldn't keep him from his mum, and it would have made me the failure I felt I was.  The truth is I was carrying guilt, because before the event of trying to keep him... I tried to take my own life. Eventually I pushed past it, but not in a very good way. I ruined the relationship between myself and my sons mum because I had to make a choice, I couldn't maintain being a dad and being a friend. So I chose being a dad and just pushed his mum away, after a few years I realised I regretted that choice, not because I chose my son. But because I realised  I should have made and effort with his mum, so that we could all build some memories together and so that my son would never have to feel like he had to live 2 separate lives.  Recently I made that effort, as did she, and we began being friends, I would now have sleep overs on the days I dropped him off, and we would all eat dinner together and have breakfast in the morning before i went home, unfortunately this has had some very serious side effects. The person I forced myself to hate so that I could cope, was showing me nothing but kindness and I began becoming wracked with guilt, and started picking fault with everything she did, not because she was doing anything wrong, but because I was ashamed of myself and the way I had treated her.. In my mind I didn't understand what her motivations were, why she would be willing to be a friend and my emotional rock after everything that had been said and done, (and I still don't) so instead of trying to understand, I just did what I had done before. I just started pushing her away.   This all built up again and my son is now old enough to notice my behaviour, and has even made comments about it. Which led me to being short and angry to him (he doesn't understand how my depression has affected me, he's only 4) he began saying how I was only happy when he was at mummy's, and in a way he was right, I was happy because on the day he went back, so did I, despite all my pushing and negativity, I was still welcome. The arguing went on for a few week before I began feeling like they would both be better off without me, no more grumpy daddy, no more negative friend.   I tried to take my life again, but when I did, I began realising I was making a huge mistake, I felt lucky to survive, but for the last few weeks I've been struggling with the guilt. I tried to leave them with one of the worst experiences ever, and what I got after was even more compassion and understanding, but I've found myself pushing them away as a result, it led to a huge fight, one I thought would be the last. It wasn't, I got yet another chance despite acting like an asshole, so I actively tried to push my fears and guilt to one side and be a decent human being. And it worked! No more drama no more fighting, just a dad enjoying the time with his son, and a friend enjoying the company of a friend... Until last night.   What started as an attempt to shed some light on how much appreciation I had towards my sons mum for the support she had given me despite the fact that I had put her through 2 years of hatred, became twisted as I tried to speak, and it just came out as more critism. And yet another fight happened... She's still fine with me but I can't keep doing this.   I'm sorry for the rather long winded story and probably terrible punctuation and formatting, but I need some advice on how the hell I'm meant to say what I feel, instead of what my depression makes me feel when I try to speak.   I want to be able to say how much I regret, how much I care, and how much I appreciate the support I've been given, by the person I never expected it from. When everyone began walking away, the person I pushed the hardest came back and has given me so much more than I deserve, but all I seem to be able to give back is insults and contempt despite just wanting to look her in the eye and say thank-you and for it to be clear how much its meant to me and how much I mean it because if I carry on as I am, I don't think I'll be able to get back up from the bottom next time, I never want to be back in the hospital because I've fucked up so badly with my son or his mum and think it's better for them if I were to be dead. So any advice from others would be great.   How do you turn off the part of you that makes a mess of the situation to allow your self to say thank-you? I aparrently have no issue saying things to potentially thousands of strangers, so is there a way to transfer that honesty to being done one-on-one??   ",0.8354479530188988,1

As if it's something you ""must"" do once you reach a certain age, no matter how ill-equipped you are. If reincarnation truly does exist, this just ensures that human life will plod on and continue its suffering in perpetuity.  I just don't see that as a reason to celebrate.

417,"Never have I ever been so upset I‚Äôm a horrible person for thinking so. So I currently have a family drama problem. 1 [mom 55] 1 [dad 50], 3 [half/step-brothers 42, 32, 30], 1 [brother 23], and me [22].  My brother(let‚Äôs call him) Jay, he just recently graduated in early summer. He came back home to live with us (mom, Dad and me - I want to point out in our culture it‚Äôs okay for family to live all together even if your above age of 18, though me and my brother are Americanized but we aren‚Äôt financially stable to own our own apartment since they cost around 2/3k a month).  One of my step brother (let‚Äôs call him) Harry, he go into a fight, supposedly for ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù but with his stature he was put in jail, lost his job because he didn‚Äôt show up. His neighbor who he had punch didn‚Äôt press charges, most likely because the guy knows my oldest step brother Nate who had most likely talked to him (Nate talked me and Jay about he knows the ‚Äúroommate‚Äù/‚Äúneighbor‚Äù). Harry decides to move out of the complex because ‚Äúif he ever sees the guy again he‚Äôs going to kill him‚Äù.  So now Harry is currently jobless, and lives in his car that our mom had bought for him and now everyday comes to the house and does nothing. In which I wanna say he is so ungrateful, he got mad at my mom for not being able to purchase his car first hand because she didn‚Äôt have any credit. And now that Nate set up credit cards for our mom she now has credit and was able to purchase Harry his new/used car.  My mom begged him to forgive her for not always being there for him and not being the mother he had wanted her to be. She said she saw Harry smile in such a long time and that he was really happy for a bit. But in my mind, Harry is just using my mom, I told her ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just smiling because he played you, he‚Äôs happy because he got a car out of you‚Äù I said this because after 2 weeks of him receiving the car I asked him how he liked his new car. And then he goes off about how he didn‚Äôt like it and how much he hated it and saying why don‚Äôt you ask X about what they think huh???  And for years since he had left the house he has been nothing but a pain in the ass. He‚Äôs going to cause the death of my mother. He acts such a fucking child saying he CAUSED the WEALTH of our family when in all he only did his part. Ever since Jay and I could walk we had to help the family for years!!! We are the reason why Mom can afford his car insurance, phone bills, medical bills AND living expenses and everyone else (the other step brothers). And then he goes off on a rant ON ME on how I‚Äôm such a fucking child ‚Äúnews flash this little girl ...!! Saying he‚Äôs my fucking father and that they never raised me! I‚Äôm your father I‚Äôm the reason why you have a life I‚Äôm the reason why you can get a job‚Äù. Whenever I defend myself he makes about him and how Mom and everyone else treated him!  Once I did feel really bad but I couldn‚Äôt act upon it because he‚Äôll act like a physco and he is very unapproachable. I want to believe there‚Äôs a good man inside but he is so full of hatred and toxicity I cannot be near him.  And now I can‚Äôt stand the sight of him inside the house I fucking hate it!!!!! I fucking hate him so much! He‚Äôs such a damn nuisance I sometimes wished he really did overdose then maybe just maybe ... my mom wouldn‚Äôt be so stressed she wouldn‚Äôt have hold back on happiness she always blames herself and she works till death she works until she can‚Äôt even move she works until she passes out in the car!! She comes back from work and sleeps in the car! I‚Äôll go outside and she‚Äôll still be asleep in the car in the morning!!!!! But it wouldn‚Äôt matter even if he had passed away, the pain he had inflicted emotionally into my mom will never go away.  He‚Äôs been in the house for a month now he barges into Jays room unannounced and goes on his computer. And I work with my brother Jay who ends up yelling and cursing because he wasn‚Äôt able to sleep with all the clicking. Like even before when I went to high school (when I didn‚Äôt have a lock in my room) he would come in and eat and watch tv and play games until 3am!!! Like WTFFFFF 3am fuck I need to freaking sleep!!!!!!! And times he would barge in when I was fucking changing WTHHHHH and it happened TWice.... TWICEEE and then.

438,"Schizoaffective Mother Draining My Energy and Making Me Feel Bad About Life My mother is diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. For those who do not know about this type of mental illness, it is basically a combination between Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. Her symptoms include mania and depression with an add-on depending on her delusion and paranoia.   Prior to us migrating to the US, I have always thought my mother was great when I was younger. However, the stress of living in the US in poverty was too much for her and the negative criticism from her family members broke her down and she developed Schizoaffective Disorder. I eventually was placed in foster care after an incident where her delusion resulted in her physically abusing me was witnessed by a residential manager where my mother and I stayed.  Foster care wasn't paradise but I learned a lot from being in numerous placements. I understood how other culture operated and how a normal family was supposed to run from the sideline. I have always understood that the family that I was placed with are not my blood and there are barriers because of that - realizing it made me sad at first and it still do but that's the reality of nature. Throughout my foster care years, my mother was on and off her meds before she finally stabilized for a long period of time throughout my high school and college years.   Recently, she went off her meds again and that was an ordeal that I won't soon forget. I have made several posts about that in r/needavice but I won't mentioned that here because I wanted to rant about the emotions that I am feeling reeling from my mother's behaviors.   My mother is currently getting an injection every month (which I hope she is telling me the truth about that) so she's somewhat stable. I feel so suffocated by my mother in a sense that I feel that I might step on a landmine everyday having her in my life. When she recently went off her meds, I asked her why she wasn't taking her meds and she said it was because she was angry at my uncle and me. I didn't say it straight to her but I thought to myself that it was unfair that she would punish our stable lives by going off her meds. Just last week, she saw a picture of me at my Aunt's place and she got sad saying why did I visited my Aunt instead of her. I tried telling her that when she was off her meds my Aunt/ her best friend was extremely helpful in making sure that she's okay. She was the one that acted like a mother to me when my own mother was yelling on the street and having delusion thoughts. During her episodes, I was so scared of her and my Aunt was there for me to help and give me the support for me call the police/ help for my mother. When I told her that, my mother interpreted that I don't love her but all I was trying to make her understand that I am just a kid and I am scared of you when you're off your meds.   My mother gets angry easily by things that don't go her ways. There's no logical reasoning to her. Every time I tried to reason my perspective with her she said that she's older than me and that I have to listen to her and that I don't know anything. If I continue to press my opinion on a matter then she would throw something like if anyone that she doesn't like (my uncle/ her brother or my aunt/ best friend) have taught me to say these things to her. I feel abuse and this severely hurt my self-esteem as it seems like I can't even hold my own perspective/ opinion about anything.   As I said, my mother have a hard time to getting along with people. While my uncle is her brother and aunt is her best friend, if she gets mad at them then she won't talk or call them, in turns they just avoid her until she needs their help. I have a hard time following the same strategy as they do because I want my mom to be well. It's just difficult to be interactive with my mother. I have to watch what I say and what I do around her for her to not be angry at me. Although I live close to my mother, I have been lying to her about where I live because I don't feel comfortable with telling her my new place where she might show up with an episode and cause a scene.   Because of my past, I have been a passive person and never liked confrontation. I have observed and concluded that my mother holds grudges about what have happened. I have multiple times tell her that she has to let go of the past and be happy but she insist that whoever have done us wrong in the past we must return the favors. She doesn't connect well with others and instead put a lot of pressure on me to give her the love of a community and unrequited which I am happy to if she would return the logicality and understanding that I am looking for. But she does not and I feel discouraged, sad, angry, disappointed, worrisome, and anxious whenever I talk to her.   I have been involved in my mother's case planning with disabilities services and they're disappointing. Multiple times, I have to chase service providers down and play phone chase with them just to get updates on my mother. The timetables that they give me are never accurate about when they would return my calls or give me the information that I need to help my mother.   I have talked to my support group which includes my mentor, friends, extended-family members, and foster family and they have given me some advice but I still feel isolated. My mentor have told me that even if I move away and cut off all my contact with my mother then I would not be satisfied because I would worry about her.   Right now, I feel bleak and despair. I know life is unfair but when do things look up from here. I feel alone and too immature to handle this kind of situation. I feel that I don't have the permission to live the life that I want to live but rather picking up the messes that my mother leave behind and having to entertain her.

451,"I'm getting tired of ""someday""s and ""maybe""s I'm 35-year- old female that's been fighting depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I see a therapist and on treatment but that only goes so far. I know it's because I never really had control of my life.   Growing up, my family had my best interests in mind but somehow they figured I didn't know what's best for me. I went to a horrible Middle/High school with uncertified teachers solely because it was the only private school in the area, they forced me to date a guy who put on a big act in front of them but sexually harassed me when they weren't looking, and they chose my college even though it didn't have the major I wanted. I majored in Graphic Design but I never had any talent nor interest in it. I wanted to travel and study languages in order to be an interpreter, but I was told that was a dead field and ""someday you'll get to travel but not right now."" I came from a Spanish speaking family but never learned the language. Whenever I asked they always said ""maybe one day"".  I did get to choose my Grad School, an art school, but about year later,I realized there was no way I'd make it in the Graphic Design field. I wanted to switch schools but my family convinced me that would be a huge mistake even though my own professors suggested I find another career. I started cutting in order to deal with the pain and embarrassment.   I continued to beg my family to teach me Spanish so I could have something to fall back on. They would just say ""You don't need to learn it. Your Master's degree will guarantee a good job. Maybe one day.""   I was so bad at Graphic Design that it took 6 years to earn my Master's. I constantly fill out job applications just to be told an art degree wouldn't be a good fit for the position. Yet Spanish speakers without a high school diplomas are getting hired for the same position I applied for. I've been working the same boring retail job that I hate with a passion for 10 years but I can't quit because I don't know what else to do.  The only advice my family has is to "" stick with it and maybe someday you'll be the CEO."" I want to start traveling and learning languages but they keep saying, ""You're too old to learn a new language now. Maybe when you retire you can practice when you're bored.""   Now here I am, straddled with so much student loan debt that I cannot go back to school, working in a retail store, a Substitue Teacher once a week, (which I hate even more), no relationship,no house, barely making enough to pay rent, and no clue how to get out if this rut. My therapist just says ""maybe someday things will get better."" I've attempted suicide twice already and was institutionalized 4 times.   I've already tried networking and self-help books. How can I get a better job if I can't afford to go back to school? I really want to be a medical interpreter but that will take years and money that I don't have.

I parked at Kroger the other day and when I came out there were THREE carts just left mere feet away from my SUV. To top it off the carts weren't in the usually shitty spots you find them when people leave them out. (Usually somewhere in front of where you are trying to park). No these were placed BEHIND my vehicle.  I had to move the carts just to get out.  Fuck you. If I see you do this. I WILL call you out on it. Bastards. I have two vehicles. One is an older 2005 Pathfinder which I LOVE and take care of and recently it's been beat up because of you ass wipes. I also have a new vehicle that I have to park 800 miles away in order to avoid you scum bags and somehow, there will be a random cart RIGHT next to it. HOW?  ",0.2409265210550241,0
473,"You can buy things on the internet now? So yesterday a bought a new mixer for djing. When j got it home I noticed it didn't come with the cables I need to get sound out of it (which wasn't supposed to be included in the pack being the idiot that i am i didnt bother to check).   So by the time I realise it's 10 to 6 and most of the shops that would sell it would be closed by now. The only shops open in the area that would sell it and were open were Tesco, open until 11 and cex open until 6. For those not in the know, cex is a shop that buys and sells games, consoles, laptops, phones etc second hand.   So with 10 mins I went there first. I ran down there, nearly got ran over in the process, got to the door just as they're moping up. I come in out of breath and say ask the guy if they sell the cables. He starts looking around confused for a minute then says ""I don't think we sell cables actually."" Now that's not a problem it was a long shot and it isn't his fault what they do and don't sell. So I say,   ""it's cool man, thought I'd just check"" then his next line just fucking infuriated me.   ""The best thing to do is look online"" seriously? Does he think I'm stupid? Does he think I've never heard of buying things on the internet? If I wanted them tomorrow, or more likely in a few days, I would of bought them online. It would be been a hell of a lot cheaper, ",0.09361403232547932,0

I feel like the only way for people to like me, is that I just don't say anything. Nobody is interested in things that I say. Everybody is happy if they can talk about themselves. Nobody wants to listen to me. Everybody just wants to tell about how beautiful and great their life is. Or they tell me about their problems. I always try to listen. But why won't anybody listen to me... I lost everybody just because I tried to also tell them about my life. But apparently this only causes people to leave and avoid me.",0.6419232397996105,1

480,"Nothing makes it harder to respect an adult than when they blow a fucking gasket over the tiniest shit. When I was a kid I got scared when my dad would flip out over some insignificant bullshit. He was never violent or abusive or anything, he just had zero patience and liked starting arguments whenever he was in a bad mood. He's gotten better about it but his behavior left me with an inability to take people like that seriously.  Seriously guys, nothing makes you seem more childish than yelling. For 99.9 percent of normal human interactions, if you are the first person to escalate an argument into a screaming match, you have failed as an adult. If your mere presence puts everyone in the room on edge, you have an anger problem. If you take out your frustration with normal, tiny, every day inconveniences on those around you, you are a fucking child.  Now if you have anger management problems, you have a choice. You can either recognize it and make efforts to be a calmer, more considerate human being, or you can bury that introspection deep inside you and keep insuring that the only way anybody will take you seriously is if they're scared of you.  Because that's what happened with my dad's behavior. When I was old enough that the fear was gone, a lot of the respect went with it. He had to earn that back by learning how to control his anger, and he has done a wonderful job of that. It's been years since I've seen him overreact to anything and in that time not only has he become a happier person but he is much closer to his family as a result.  So please if you find yourself getting angry a lot, see someone. Do something. You'll be so much happier and respected for it.

481,"I just want someone to try to be interested Every day for the past two years I use a variety of online dating apps regularly. I dedicate nearly an hour every single day to them. I've paid stupid amounts of money on some of them and I genuinely put effort into every person I match with and every greeting I make.  But I get ghosted and ignored. Non stop. The rare 1 out of 100 that finally meets ends up with a hookup and I'm tired of them. I can't do another hookup. It is destroying me. I ended my last date because it was clearly heading into hookup territory to my dismay and I have lost a ton of sleep over it.  I cannot get to know you if you don't try to get to know me. I hear from women constantly how there are so many guys, they're all rude and condescending and just want sex. And here I am being genuine, trying really hard not to be like them because clearly I'm doing something wrong, and you just end up ghosting me.  I cannot keep living like this. I just want to encounter someone who even pretends to be interested in me. Even if it doesn't go anywhere I just want the chance to talk to someone and feel like I'm not just dancing and juggling knives to be impressive.

482,"So this friend trolled me on Twitter and I feel pissed because it feels like I lost some respect. You know that moment when you tweet or write or say something like ""I think the govt should be strict with environment laws"" and an ahole jumps on you saying ""Well I don't see you taking a bike to work""? I just had something similar with a different topic. A friend who never engages with me on Twitter ever, just tweeted something that infuriating. I'm pissed, I feel my stomach is burning and turning, and I wish I didn't reply to that ignorant dude. It feels like I look smaller now because I got into that stupid tweets back and forth looking just stupid. I hate it when things like that happen and makes me feel that I was insulted or look bad. It's really intoxicating to feel this way. People around me are a breeze to be with, but I feel away from them because my mind is occupied with that moment, and how bad or small or stupid I might have looked because of what he said to me and how I engaged in that stupid short conversation.

483,"Women are Disgusting Bathroom Creatures This is the third time in two weeks I've gone to use the ladies room in my new office building in the mornings apart from my typical bathroom routine, and it's the third time I've walked out nearly throwing up. We have those ""public stall"" type bathrooms with those goddamn gaps in the doors and the women in our building who use this bathroom are such pigs. I'm a super clean person and it's driving me mad having to use the damn bathroom at work instead of holding it in till after lunch or till I get to the hotel cause, well, some women apparently don't know how to clean up after themselves even though they can dress up all fine and pretty.   Why is there literal shit everywhere all the time?! Today the shit was on the toilet paper! I get that you're having explosive diarrhea or whatever,  but Jesus Christ, would it kill you to clean up your own mess?! Shit smeared TP pieces on the floor, shit smeared on the toilet seats. Today was shit on the roll of TP. TP on the floor of the stalls, TP clogging up one of the toilets. Water all over the goddamn counters and the floor from these bitches flying water everywhere to get to the paper dispenser. Pee stains on the seats. They miss the bag stuffing their tampons into the little bin and it's disgusting. Roll your shit tighter and then it'll fit properly, dammit! There's enough TP to wipe down and clean up after yourself even if you make a mess, but noooooooooooooo. Just leave it for the next sorry sap to witness the color of your bodily waste.  This is an office setting where people dress slighty casual all day everyday, not a gas station or Walmart bathroom. I don't get it. The janitor guys only clean the bathroom once a day, after the typical lunch hour, and I feel so bad for him having to deal with all that. I need to take a bath in bleach! ",0.1827407798171183,0
484,"Chess.com is the fucking worst. So, if you play chess occasionally, like I do, you may have heard of the magical website of ""chess.com"". This website is perfectly fine for playing chess against random people. However, if you are like me and my friend who like to play chess IRL, but just don't want to leave the house sometimes, then chess.com is horrible.   One day, me and my friend decided that we were going to play online on chess.com. I had an account, but he didn't. He made one and activated it and tried to find where to search for my name to add me. No luck.   I, however, found a search box to look for users. I searched for his name, and no results. At all. I used another search box, and no luck. I then went online to figure out how the hell you were supposed to add people, and it said that you had to add them on live chess chat. I looked that up, and it turns out that you have to randomly come across your friend on live chess to be able to add them (or so chess.com says).   I ended up having to go onto the forum, create a post that pretty much says nonsense, and had my friend look it up. This is already hot garbage, but it gets worse. So much worse.   I then looked around to see if I could find a way to invite him to a game. I invited him to a game of chess, he joined... and I wasn't able to join. I went on my profile to see games I was currently playing (it said that there were none) and I went on his. It said the same thing.   I then went to ""live chess"" where you can play a live game of chess with a random person. There was an option to play with a friend. I chose it, and invited my friend. This time, I was in the game, but he wasn't. I told him to check his notifications and he said that they were empty. By this point, we were so pissed off at the utter garbage that is chess.com, we decided to just meet up and play real chess.   So that's why chess.com is a piece of absolute horseshit.

We‚Äôre sitting outside on the porch of your parents‚Äô summer cabin, enjoying whatever time we still have left together. You‚Äôre happy, I‚Äôm riddled with anxiety and self-doubt. I keep wondering whether we still have a future together, or whether I‚Äôve spent these past two and a half years with someone who doesn‚Äôt even love me anymore.  I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm feeling this way, but I am. I've hated myself since middle school, and you're the only one who understood and tried to help me.

I‚Äôm relieved. Happy.  What I don‚Äôt know is that the next night on our drive back to North Dakota, a deer will appear out of nowhere on the road. I manage to swerve the car away from him, only to fly off the road and hit a tree. Both of my arms are broken, as well as three of my ribs, and my skull is fractured. You didn‚Äôt put your seatbelt back on when we left the gas station an hour ago. You fly out of the car through the windshield and hit the tree head first. You die on impact.
