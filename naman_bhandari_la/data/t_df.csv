0,"Sometimes life just sucks. I don’t even know what to do with myself. I took a year off of college to pursue some passion projects that I didn’t know if I’d ever have another chance to do it. I’m young, my parents were nice enough to let me take this year off so I’m home with them. Here’s what’s happened so far:  In the first month I crashed and totaled my car. I live in a very small town 20-25 minutes away from the closest place and I have no friends here so I can’t leave very often.   In the second month my dad lost his job so we can’t afford to do anything, let alone get me a car for a while. I’m working minimum wage so doubt I’ll get a car soon. Bonus: I now have to choose between getting a car or doing my passion projects because I’ll probably only have the money for one.   In the third month, this month, my PC’s hard drive just caved in on itself. A couple days ago it just up and broke. No chance of repair. In this small town this PC was my connection to others through gaming, my source of entertainment, and my only way of planning and slightly pursuing my passion projects.   I have nothing to do, nowhere to go, no money for what I need in order to solve those first problems. I don’t want to wake up next month and continue this streak. ",0

2,"Being disregarded I feel like I don’t mean much to other people. I do try to be nice and reciprocate when I can. Which isn’t very often, but not because I’m not willing. There’s simply no opportunity to do so. For example, I lived in a large city for a long time without a car, and if I wanted to see any friends who lived in the suburbs, I would have to take the train and then rely on them for a ride to wherever we were going to, and then for a ride back to the train station. I feel like this may have built resentment, but that’s just what my circumstances were.  I have since moved out of this city to somewhere more rural to be with my mother. Circumstances dictated it. But this weekend I have chosen to return to the city for a long weekend. I don’t know when I will do this again because it is expensive.  I have told a couple of people that I will be here. One friend I hope will see me, though she is the one that has to pick me up and drop me off at the train station. The other friend I’m not sure what’s in her mind. This woman just lost her partner to suicide in late June. I offered to treat her to lunch, she declined and said we would go Dutch. I haven’t heard from her since I made my offer. I have a feeling I offended her in some way. I did not mean to, I simply wanted to raise her spirits if I could. There’s times I think that I am just offensive to people even though I mean well.  To be honest, I have a work history that didn’t always go so well and I relied on family support, and most people know this. I feel like this must affect people’s opinions of me, because they don’t seem that interested that I am here.",0
3,"Nothing makes it harder to respect an adult than when they blow a fucking gasket over the tiniest shit. When I was a kid I got scared when my dad would flip out over some insignificant bullshit. He was never violent or abusive or anything, he just had zero patience and liked starting arguments whenever he was in a bad mood. He's gotten better about it but his behavior left me with an inability to take people like that seriously.  Seriously guys, nothing makes you seem more childish than yelling. For 99.9 percent of normal human interactions, if you are the first person to escalate an argument into a screaming match, you have failed as an adult. If your mere presence puts everyone in the room on edge, you have an anger problem. If you take out your frustration with normal, tiny, every day inconveniences on those around you, you are a fucking child.  Now if you have anger management problems, you have a choice. You can either recognize it and make efforts to be a calmer, more considerate human being, or you can bury that introspection deep inside you and keep insuring that the only way anybody will take you seriously is if they're scared of you.  Because that's what happened with my dad's behavior. When I was old enough that the fear was gone, a lot of the respect went with it. He had to earn that back by learning how to control his anger, and he has done a wonderful job of that. It's been years since I've seen him overreact to anything and in that time not only has he become a happier person but he is much closer to his family as a result.  So please if you find yourself getting angry a lot, see someone. Do something. You'll be so much happier and respected for it.  This was supposed to be a rant but I guess it turned into a PSA?",0

9,"I have bipolar 2 and I can’t find any real help. I’m 30 years old and I live in New England. I’ve struggled with depression since I was a child. And I have bipolar type 2. The first time I talked to someone about it was in high school. I’ve seen many many many therapists and psychiatrists. I’ve been to support groups and read books. Here are my issues with finding help:  Over the years whether I had health insurance or not it’s been tough to find someone who accepts my insurance or to find a provider I can afford out of pocket.  Even if you do find someone, your availability can be an issue.  On top of that you have to actually call and follow up. Which I never want to do in the first place!! This part has been annoying because some of the staff members at these offices are rude. How do these people not care that the person calling is sensitive and they are looking for help? Or that their job is customer service. Wtf.   I’ve started from scratch so many times and I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be getting out of therapy. Psychiatrists are prescribing me the wrong combination of meds and my therapists aren’t getting me to open up. I’m paying a copay to tell them about my day at work.   There’s no place for me to go. There’s no correct combination of meds to take. No one is listening to me.  Why are inpatient treatment facilities for addicts only? Where are the hospitals for depression????  I’m at a point now where I can’t afford to buy another insurance policy outside of the one from my employer. I’m considering a new job to try another health insurance. I have NHP and it’s trash.   I watch shows and listen to podcasts and everyone on there is texting their therapists and having these great relationships. Where are these doctors for me!?",1
10,"English 102 made me hate being social The majority of this course was taking great pieces of art and analyzing them to fine details and try to interpret meanings from the author. While I agree many works of art hold a deeper message, it carries on to us as social creatures. This class acts like everything HAS to have a hidden message and that so long as you can back up your ideas, the answer is not wrong. How this places into social life is that it makes us think everything we do in life then has a message attached to it. Why can't we just do something because we like doing it? Wearing a pink backpack doesn't mean I am fighting for the cause of breast cancer... it just means I like the color pink and I chose to get it.    I hate English 102 because this is a core class in the first year of college. It has made me fearful of the things I do because it further enforces the idea that everything we do is sending a message to others.",0
11,"New driver screwed me over I got into a car accident last week.  I was passing through an intersection and someone going the opposite direction was waiting to turn left.  He thought I was back far enough that he would have made the turn but he thought wrong, I ended up t-boning him.    Cops ended up declaring it as his fault, thankfully there were witnesses that caught it all too.  ​  While I'm glad he and I came out of it fine I'm just furious that my car will now decrease in value when I trade it in (was planning on trading it in mid September!).  Insurance declared that the damages are worth over $10k and they're still not writing it off.  Don't even think the other driver knows how hard he fucked me over.  ​  On the bright side he has only had his driver's license (learner's license) for 1.5 months and he's still fairly young.  So hopefully his insurance sky rockets from this and it keeps him off the road.    I know accidents happen... but I really needed to rant.",0
12,"My miracle - should it be of any help. First off, I'd like to provide some background information about me. I'm a 21 year old brazilian male who lives in Guarulhos, São Paulo (so excuse me for my english beforehand). I've been battling depression/anxiety since I was 16. The most obvious causes (or symptoms) of my problem seem to be social isolation, and general overthinking existentialism (also the quiet likely chemical imbalance). I started treatment about two and a half years ago at a point in which I was already in really bad shape, and my problem seemed to have become chronic. I struggle a lot with religion and as of now am not affiliated in any. I used to be Catholic and took it pretty seriously for about two years before some things started to make no sense anymore. My family is split Catholic/Kardecism (which I've also flirted with). I have been committed to a psych ward in the beginning of 2017 due to feeling anxious and suicidal. I couldn't stay there as I was assaulted by another patient in an incident. I take fluoxetine (which will be replaced), lithium, citalopram, risperidone and the occasional benzodiazepine. I am in therapy. I have tried meditation and hypnosis (gotta take a better shot at the former). I have also tried homeopathy.  I have never attempted suicide, although getting really close to. I think we're now good for me to tell the story.      Earlier this year I lost my job. I was working at “Detran”, which in the US would be the DMV. A fairly simple six hour job that was helping me get by and keep my head busy. Feeling guilty and hopeless about being unable to hold a job or even keep my mind clear for a second, I felt like I was losing my sanity, and became increasingly suicidal again. I was desperate and wanted to be committed to a psych ward again so I wouldn’t hurt myself. At this period I was praying a lot, even though not participating in any religious affiliation anymore. I was obsessed about thoughts of the existence of god, the supernatural, the afterlife, you name it. I was holding on to stories I've heard from my family about inexplicable events to account for the existence of the spiritual world, which gave me hope (even though some of the stories aren't exactly cute). An example of that would be my mother dreaming of my deceased grandmother bringing her babies that would be born in the family - this happened three times in which my mother would know the gender and appearance of the babies before they were born. Another example (more extreme) would be of my mother meeting my deceased grandmother's spirit while awake, having an out of body experience - that same day, my aunt also felt my grandmother's presence and cried (they talked on the phone later that day). There are other stories, but I can't afford sharing all of them now. I'll just go straight to the point.     My mother owns a cake shop near where we live. All sorts of people come by as you might guess. One day a woman came by and told her to paint the walls orange for prosperity, my mom dismissed the comment and told me about it later as I wasn't there that day. So the next day, with a lot of persistence my mom convinces me to come with her to the shop, not wanting to leave me alone in the apartment. So I do. We open by nine, and by ten-ish the woman from the previous day returns and greets me, saying she needs to talk to my mother. She says she couldn't sleep and that God had touched her heart. She needed to gives us a thousand reais (which would be something like three hundred dollars, sorry, don't know the exchange rate). We were of course shocked and refused, afraid of being scammed at first. She explained she didn't know why she had to, but this had happened before. Once she had met a saleswoman on the beach, felt touched, and gave her money - as it turns out, this woman was going to be evicted. Similarly, she had passed by a car dealership, felt touched to enter and offer money: the owner was about to have his electricity cut off that day. She explained she dealed with properties and was relatively well-off. Plus, she owned a hair salon nearby. She called in people to testify in her favor – her daughter, tenant. They all testified in her favor, told us she was a by all means honest woman, and advised us to accept our blessing. Still we refused, acknowledging the fact we didn’t know her nor felt comfortable with the situation, even if it meant rejecting our blessing. We are middle-class, pay rent and struggle, but we’re also not in need of anything.   The woman insisted a lot, told us she was a Protestant, and attested to the fact that this sort of thing happens for a reason. At last, she was going to wait for a mutual friend that works in a shop right next to ours to come, someone that we knew to testify in her favor – he wasn’t there at that moment. So she asked for a cup of coffee and sat down. My mom headed back to the kitchen, and I stayed at the counter. We served her. Right after that, the woman started singing quietly. It was a hymn, and my mother could hear it. When she did, she asked me if I could hear her singing too, and I told her I did. She told me that was my grandmother’s favorite hymn – as she was a Protestant too. My mother said she was praying in the kitchen for a sign when this happened. I was stupefied the whole time, couldn’t believe the entire thing. My mother told the woman what just happened, and decided to keep the money. They were crying and hugging - I still wasn’t sure what to make of anything. The woman got her credit card and debited it right there. She explained she would never return to collect, or charge for the money or anything. Soon after that, she left.   This happened on March this year. As I absorbed what happened, I tried to make sense of it. I am still dumbfounded. I am a skeptical person, and every time I tell this story I know inside that it’s me that I’m still trying to convince. I am still trying to understand. But it still gets a little crazier. As months went by, I looked for the woman to thank her, and explain to her what that had meant for us. So I did – she wasn’t hard to find, because as I explained she owned a hair salon nearby. While we were talking she revealed to me she knew I was depressed beforehand and that God had “showed me bare” to her. Afterwards, she invited me to her church. I was a little upset and thought that that was her trying to “convert” me or get me to join in her church – which I explained I probably wouldn’t do as I had gotten out the Catholic church recently and was feeling suspicious and distant about the whole thing. Still, she insisted I came by at least once, for God “was going to talk to me” there. I did go, and fair enough, the sermon had a lot to do with my situation – it discussed depression and feeling abandoned by god. Nevertheless, religion was still having an upsetting effect on me, and even though the sermon really did seem to be somehow directed at me, it’s not like I had a revelation or anything. I was kind of bummed, thinking God was trying to talk to me in many ways but I was still having a hard time feeling better, and not being able to help being so skeptical.  After all that happened, I still found myself in a bad place, not being able to make sense of so many things, and having to deal with low-mood and episodes. Not soon after that, I wanted to be committed to a psych ward yet again, afraid of hurting myself. The day we were searching for a clinic, I got a new job, and decided to stick it out. Getting that job was a very interesting thing, and there I met two people who had similar problems to mine. I lost that job also, but managed to make very meaningful connections to my workmates – including sharing this story to them in the intention of helping them. As of now, I am kind of messy and trying to get by. If I were to tell you what I think about this story I would say: I do believe it was a supernatural occurrence, and I do believe that was God’s way of showing me he exists, and that the spiritual world is real (by telling us my grandmother is watching us). The odds are just so crazy. I was praying specifically for a sign for months (even though in Christianity you’re not exactly encouraged to do so) so I wouldn’t kill myself because I just couldn’t stand it anymore. And that week I had been thinking hard about all my grandmother’s stories to believe in something – I never met her because she passed away before I was born. Then this happens. Out of nowhere, on an ordinary day, right in front of me.   I feel very split about telling this story. It’s a serious story from despair – nothing I take lightly – and it seems to be meant for desperate people too (not only though). I admit I am very wary about the reactions. The first thing about it is that people might think it’s not real, for which I can’t really say anything, but ask them to take my word for it, and that for obvious reasons I can’t be more specific about it – place, people involved. Second, but also related to the first, that this story is intended to proselytize, recruit, or evangelize – as I explained I am not a part of any religious affiliation, and this is not advocating any. Third, but related to the formers, that it’s real intention might not be well received – but that’s a risk I have to take. It’s intention is indeed one of faith in God. I don’t mean this to have any sort of hidden agenda, and I am well aware that all interpretations and points of view are beyond my grasp, that there is really no control to what people can make of this – I probably shouldn’t even worry about it, but hey. Part of the problem of believing in God is the difficulty in knowing him, so what I believe in is the initiative in getting to know him – why we would not want the most precious thing we could have? This is another reason why I would never make up something like this: this is indeed a story for desperate people. And I, like for myself, don’t want anybody else to feed themselves with illusions in order to overcome whatever they have to. I believe that true strength can never come from lies. And faith should not the opposite of reason, it should be based on it.  That being said, although I’m keen on justifications, I never had to look too much around to hear the strangest stories from all kinds of people, and I guess you don’t have to dig that deep either. Mystery is a fact. I shall not linger any further, I hope the massage is received, and I’ll be available for questions.  Sorry for maybe not being succinct enough, but as Mark Twain once said: “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one”.  TLDR; A miracle has happened to me, and I am still holding on because of it. There are reasons to believe.  --- Please tell me if I should make any corrections.",1
13,"Dont you hate it when people try to convince you that you don't have depression? I honestly think that I've been depressed for over a year and half now. Other people think otherwise.

Its been eating me alive for the past year and half!"" Well what the hell, the first thing he says is ""wdym? my son has nothing like that! its just ur brain :)"" NOPE FUCK NO ITS NOT MY BRAIN AND STOP TRYIN TO CONVINCE ME LIKE THAT well thats just an example but yeah people should stop trying to convince depressed people to be not depressed",1

15,"Day 1 of the project was a shit show ...however, contrary to my title, we actually expected a shit show. What I didn't expect, was people that knew for weeks and months would be all like ""OMG I didn't realize it would be this bad?"" Really? After months and months of trainings and readiness, the least attentive people were like, ""What button do I push?"" Technology changes in every and any business can be tough. I admit there were things we didn't expect today; things I didn't expect and test for....the things I didn't see in weeks of testing were a surprise today. What AMAZES me, are the things we saw in weeks of testing that we constantly warned people of during months and months and weeks and weeks and meetings and meetings of training! The people that were prepped for things, ONLY experienced the unforseen tragedies of a system change. The people that are already crap on the job, only complained about the things we already warned about, provided training for, and provided extensive details for workarounds. Not everyone is capable of adapting to technology changes, I get that. But how much lead time do you need? When we tell you for 3+ months to be prepared for this one thing, BE FUCKING PREPARED FOR IT! At the end of the day all you had to do was click this different button with a different color (like green to let you know it was OK to click vs. RED which meant it wasn't OK to click.) We tried....we didn't fail everyone. We just failed the people that apparently can't read an e-mail that comes out every other day for three months. It's like driver's that can't get a driver's license because they don't know the three different colors on a traffic light. RED (Stop) Yellow (Caution) Green (Go). HOW HARD IS THAT?",0

I don't wanna move schools cause I have good friends and bad people in my school. I'm just a little bit far, have rabbit teeth, fat neck and all that stuff. This is what people mostly target me for. I want to always go home and play games with randos and have a better time than at school. I hate everything about school",1
31,"Becoming stupid I’ve constantly moaned about work.   So, despite feeling like death when I woke up, I followed the basics: get up and go to work. It sounds trivial but I’ve slumped into habit of staying in bed for hours in despair before I eventually got into the office.  In the office, I did what I planned to do today - read and research. The panic grew when I couldn’t find the answer to a seemingly simple matter.   At the end of the day, I did a lot of research but still have no answer. My anxiety has taken over my mind.   I asked a senior colleague. At first he was very certain of his answer. But when I presented him with some research, he seemed to be less certain. So I still don’t have an answer.   Despite trying to make this a productive day, I found out that I’m stupid and indecisive. ",1
32,"School favors extroverts and I hate it... I really wish schools and professors were more understanding of people with social anxiety, shyness, etc. There are so many people who don't participate much in class not because they don't want to, but because they literally can't without having some sort of mental freak-out. Yet participation remains a big part of grades and a lot of the time you can't fulfill it without speaking up in class at least every time. Some of my professors have offered other opportunities to get an A in participation (office hours, emailing questions), but the majority have not. And the worst thing is when professors claim to understand the struggle of shyness when they really don't- I've had multiple professors say: ""I understand that you're shy, but nobody is going to judge you! Just talk!"" First of all, most people who are shy know this. The knowledge does not cure the shyness. Second of all, if it was as easy as ""just doing it"" nobody would have problems. I'm tired of working twice as hard on my coursework as some other students but getting lower grades because they talk in class way more than I do. Some of them don't even contribute to the class discussion, they just talk about anything and it helps them. School really sucks sometimes... ",0
33,"Loves got me fucked up Finally found a girl that I loved with all my heart, then she tells me she wants to be alone to work on her mental health. That's fine, I understood. I find out shes inviting this guy over and she says it's not what it looks like. 2 months after telling me she wanted to be alone she moves in with him...",1
34,Anyone else on here in their twenties and never been employed? I'm pretty sure this is not a really common thing... And it sure is debilitating. Makes me feel like a totally lost cause.,1
