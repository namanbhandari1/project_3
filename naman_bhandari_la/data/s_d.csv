0,I feel like I was born just to get the shit kick out of me 
1,"Being on call for nearly every day every week is starting to irk me Basically, I watch patients, high risk. I'm only supposed to be called in when a technician isn't available or they're busy. The past 2 times not only have I been called in with more than one tech, but they were dead and everybody is on their phones, doing nothing. I've finally got my sleep schedule back to normal so I get up at 4am naturally, do my errands, and I go to bed around midnight. Got called in the moment I get into bed and had to stay at the hospital for patient watch for 12 hours both times. I'm fucking exhausted and I have a tendency to fall asleep at the wheel of I'm tired. Tried telling that to my boss, he wants me to walk, which is a temporary fix for maybe 30 minutes. So yeah, I complain because I'm concerned for my health once I go home.  Probably me just being a bitch but fuck this aggravates me."
2,"9/11 WTC first responder - Pissed and desperate  As a first responder - I'm PISSED - I call up LHI and they are understaffed and could not find the faxes of my medical releases that I sent, but I was assured that they got them .  I wont mention names on here...  LHI got all my paper work and want to send me for medical treatment for PTSD and sleep apnea that is going to impact my cardiovascular health and in due time mess with my heart! I played their games, went to their doctors, sat on phones for hours at a time and I get the run around... LHI directed my call to my ""care team"" who NEVER picks up.  I leave messages and not even a call back. I'm GETTING sicker and I need some kind of certificate from the WTC Health network. I can not work. Im scared when I enter buildings. I had to move out of NYC up to the country - Just to get away from tall buildings and also if any - Chemical attacks.  I dont sleep = I'm on so much medication, just so I can feel somewhat normal and that stuff doesn't work. I went for counseling and feel like iam being judged and iam also giving this shrink a tragic story to talk about with his buds over a cold beer sitting around a fire pit. I have NO money - I'm on public assistance that pays for my lot rent for a mobile home and I get around $190 a month in food stamps. I'm waiting for my SSD case to be heard. (I also suffer seizures and back pain)  the back was something I was born with, but I FEEL the seizures are 9/11 related in some way - I'm sitting here venting because - I dont know what to do. I have papers from my doctors stating my conditions are permanent. I want to work but I cant' I went from making a very good salary to NOTHING    I need a break - I cant even pay my wifi or electric bill for the next few months and I need them both for my CPEP machine. the machine sends data to some doctor over wifi. I need help - Public assistance told me that the $420 for my lot rent is all they can do for me.  I need any type of assistance. I'm doing this alone with just my dog. I have no one else.     My dog says hi [https://i.imgur.com/d1amCRC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/d1amCRC.jpg)   I dont mean to come off harsh - I just need help and I'm sick of living this way.  I just need a break for once. just until my SSD comes thru. "
3,"iphone 6s screen broke -- password got inputed incorrectly cuz of the screen spam, phone dead this sucks so so much my phone basically died on me like this , lost all my photos from the april month that i had thought got saved but randomly havent anymore , fuck this, my luck so bad"
4,"I am not talented, I am skilled! This is something that makes me so mad. I can draw pretty good, in fact I studied design and fine arts and I am so happy, that I could make my passion my job. HOWEVER I really hate, whenever people see my work and say things like ""Oh you are so TALENTED"". No. It is not talent - it is skill. I didn't spend the last 10 years drawing until my fingers bled and working my butt off at university to have people pass my skill off as just ""talent"" - That counts for everything in general, I think. Talent it just the Aptitude, either you are born with it or not - skill can be acquired by anyone, although ""talent"" makes it easier for you to progress in that field. Would you tell an architect ""Wow, good job in planning that skyscraper, you are so talented!"" - Certainly, you won't."
5,"Car's broken, credit and debit card have been stolen at the gym, I've neglected to purchase notebooks and folders, and college begins tomorrow. I'm in a big mess that's partially my own fault, and I cannot see how I'll fix it by tomorrow.  Please, life, no more surprises while I'm broke and in college."
6,"School favors extroverts and I hate it... I really wish schools and professors were more understanding of people with social anxiety, shyness, etc. There are so many people who don't participate much in class not because they don't want to, but because they literally can't without having some sort of mental freak-out. Yet participation remains a big part of grades and a lot of the time you can't fulfill it without speaking up in class at least every time. Some of my professors have offered other opportunities to get an A in participation (office hours, emailing questions), but the majority have not. And the worst thing is when professors claim to understand the struggle of shyness when they really don't- I've had multiple professors say: ""I understand that you're shy, but nobody is going to judge you! Just talk!"" First of all, most people who are shy know this. The knowledge does not cure the shyness. Second of all, if it was as easy as ""just doing it"" nobody would have problems. I'm tired of working twice as hard on my coursework as some other students but getting lower grades because they talk in class way more than I do. Some of them don't even contribute to the class discussion, they just talk about anything and it helps them. School really sucks sometimes... "
7,"Don't try to lecture me when you're a glorified secretary Tried to call in a follow up appointment for a family member who is 4 days post op. Her doctor is on vacation this week and is completely booked until the end of next month, so I'll have to wait until. I tell the person on the phone who is a ""scheduling specialist"" that I was specifically ordered by the hospital to get her appointment in the next 2 weeks, so I'll call back later once I confirm with the hospital and her surgical staff.   She says in the most obnoxious, condescending voice (my voice is high pitched, so people often think I'm a kid and lecture me). "" Now honey, I'm a specialist, since your mom is post-op she actually needs to see her surgeon first, then her primary care. It won't be a problem, trust me.""   I respond with, ""I just wanna call to confirm with the hospital first and...""   ""NO, listen honey, I understand that, but I'm sure that they would wanna do it this way""  ""Well I was instructed by his team at the hospital that...""  ""I UNDERSTAND, but you need to listen to me...""  ""No thanks, bye."" Anndddd I hung up.   Probably shouldn't have done that because I'm going to have to talk to this same person to schedule a meeting, but she was trying to convince me to trust her opinion over people who actually know the condition and have been working with the patient for weeks. She called herself a ""specialist"", but she's a ""scheduling specialist"" which makes her about as qualified to give medical advice as a pre-med student who just took Bio 1. "
8,"My rant on Love Fuckfuckfuck. Love is so fucking adorable. I feel so lonely when I see anything related to love. Cute couples, cute songs, cute quotes, everything. I just want a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend. I just want to hold someone’s hand. I feel even lonelier thinking about my crush who moved away. Let’s call her Mia. God fuck, she’s adorable. She’s beautiful, and has been there every single year and day of school with me. I could never imagine a day without her, but I have to live with it. I’m not even sure she likes girls. She’s just amazing, and we cried together In eachothers arms on the last day of school. I don’t think I can find anyone like that. I fucking love love. I just wanna have that one person who’s always there, who I can always rant to, and hang out with, and I just wanna cuddle with someone. I just want that one person. I had her, but she’s gone. Love is so strange. It makes you feel the warmest, and happiest feelings ever, but it can make you feel so, so, insecure, and sick. I can’t keep up with my feelings. I love love, but it fucks me up too.   “At this moment there are 6,470,818,671 people in the world. Some are running scared. Some are coming home. Some tell lies to make it through the day. Others are just now facing the truth. Some are evil men, at war with good. And some are good, struggling with evil. Six billion people in the world. Six billion souls. And sometimes, all you need is one.” –Peyton Sawyer, one tree hill "
9,"Best friend’s family putting their dog down because her legs don’t work (they’ve neglected her for 10+ years without medication) Their treatment of Marnie has aggravated me since they got the dog. They’ve NEVER taken her to the vet, and refuse to (“why would we pay for vet bills when we have to pay for our own insurance”).   The dad is very aggressive and dismissive towards her, and no one takes her out. She’s been peeing inside for the past ten years and they blame her for it (she was previously owned by an elderly woman that couldn’t take her out so she just peed indoors). Never tried any training or anything, just yell and shame her for it.   She’s lost the ability to move both back legs now at age 13 and the family has given up and will be putting her down next week. They refuse her WATER because they don’t want her peeing in the house, even though she cries for it. We took her out the other day and they yelled at her for sneaking over to a hole in the sidewalk to drink from a puddle.   I’ve known Marnie for those 10 years and I consider her to be my own dog at times. My friend and I are in college now so Marnie is alone in the house. I try and bring it up to my friend but she says “she’s lived her life, she can’t do anything now so she’ll be happier when we put her down”. Not sure how to deal with the situation but it’s so sad and fucked up and they don’t even care. I mean why even have a dog??        TL;DR Best friend’s family has a dog (13y) that they’ve been neglecting for years, now they’re putting her down because her legs don’t work and I don’t know what to do"
10,"driving!! ugh I'm so freaking stressed out because I take my drivers test tomorrow, and I'm so concerned that I'm going to fail that I haven't been eating right or sleeping well. It just really sucks, because I want to be able to drive so badly :/"
11,"Im awful and so tired God fucking damn im an awful person.  My family keeps talking about me because I apparently ""never show emotion"" or ""empathy"" or  how I never call or message or think or even care about anyone at all.  Yeah. I don't really care too much. They are right.  I don't have friends because there is an ""impenetrable wall"" protecting a ""never ending confusion mess of a maze"" that is my brain. This means I rarely ever share things about myself and conversations tend to be about the other person or just for jokes where I don't need to give my opinion . And when I share shit about me people leave cause im oversharing. If not people leave cause I never start conversations or because of this or because of that.  Yes. I have an explanation for all of that. I have an explanation to not talking to you lot. I have a reason to ""isolate myself in my own world"". First of all, fuck you, because you don't know what my world is. I do this because not only am I an introvert, I am also tired  I am tired of how society works, im tired of talking, im tired of trying, im tired of getting out of bed, im tired of living... I am just tired of this world. Everything feels the same. Why bother discussing a topic with someone that thinks they are always right? What's the point in discussing a topic with someone that doesn't admit when they are right ? What's the point in discussing a topic when they agree with you? What is ever the point in discussing a topic, really?  I don't talk to you because I don't have anything to say either. Im not going to pull topics and thoughts out of my ass to talk to be fucking judged. There is no point in that.   Im not going to study. Why waste my time to get a fucking letter that's supposed to ""help"" me get a job in the future, as if that even mattered? Im not going to work either. In fact I don't plan on living my 20s.  What's the point in keeping up with society? It's all about presenting ourselves as the prettiest smartest and wealthiest no matter what. All about hopping on the next trend and post a picture on Instagram of our perfect shitty flawed bodies to get likes for validation from other sorry excuses of living things, except we forget they don't care. No one does. The worst is if you don't follow such trends you are judged.  And what's the deal with people giving their opinions like they are fucking facts? Do they seriously think they are worth that much? That's just sad.   Really, what's the point in doing anything if you're not even going to live your 20s? There isn't one. I am cold and numb. I don't care about your shit. Not your existence, not your problems, not your wealth, not your social status. I don't care about the trend or how important studying or exercising is. I don't act upon any responsibilities either. Say whatever you want, you know in the end im the one that's going to end up alone. And it will all be my fault. I know that. I know this incredibly stupid but the fact that I am not willing to do anything to change myself further process my worthlessness and stupidity.  I don't even know what I am saying or why im typing this. I kind of just let my brain flow as I typed shit down. I can't be assed to reread it all anyway.  Thanks for reading."
12,"Why me I'm so fucking lonely. The girl I hoped to start a relationship with forgot about me over the summer and started a relationship with a different dude. I have a total of 4 friends (including this girl) currently with me in my college town. I want to do dating apps but at the same time I dont want to. I cant stay in my dorm room because i get too angry and bored, but at the same time i dont want to leave because i have no-where to go and nothing to do. Im constantly tired and have a headache. I cant start making friends because my hearing sucks ass and no one wants to be friends with the dude who's deaf. No one texts me to go do stuff, i always have to initiate to go do stuff with ""friends"". Im struggling in my courses that im paying thousands of dollars for because im so depressed that I cant motivate myself to do anything and i cant hear the professors because the whisper half the time. Everytime i eat i feel sick and as a result i dont eat much. The only thing I can take pride in, my work, i have no one to share this pride and victory with.   My life is way too lonely and it is finally ending me."
13,"And there it is again After day 4 or 5 of coming off of 24/7 work project and focusing my free time on finishing up my classes I'm greeted with, ""You know we're going away this weekend, so I don't want any drama between you, drama between me, any complications."" I was leaving this out before.....but considering I'm the one that pays all the bills and takes care of all the pets, and no I don't take care of the house or cleaning or whatever, but after spending about 20 hours a day for the past week and most days prior to that 16 hours a day between school and work, I'm kind of sick of it. I think this ""weekend getaway"" for labor day might be when I tell him if he needs to go, or is unhappy, maybe he just needs to fucking go. Because my lack of free time is not because I don't want to spend time together, my lack of free time is because I'm trying to make a future to fulfill all these fantasies of a future real housewives of whatever that he thinks we need to fucking have. Instead of just living day to day like normal people, I'm constantly coming home to I need this, we need that, wouldn't it be nice if we had, etc. So at this point, the just holding your head above the middle class lifestyle and not drowning bit isn't enough. It's always we need more and more and fucking more....but when I work for more it's you're not doing enough, you abandon me, you treat me like shit. Symptom of people in America (when I say that in a negative stance I mean the United States), always wanting fucking more, and then chastising people when they point out that more and more and more is not doable unless you kill yourself working for it. There are people in other societies, countries, cultures, etc, etc, etc, who do not need this much all the time. My husband, for someone that came from a family that was pretty simple and did not care about always having more, he's pretty fucking demanding....and godforbid I point out that he's going overboard, it's, ""Why do you always call me stupid! I'm not stupid! Don't treat me like this! What do you think people would think if they knew you abused me like this!"" As my friend Joy would say....Les Sigh!"
14,"Whelp the girl I love is in love with my sister...NEXT! Just found out the girl I've been pining over is in love with my sister via Instagram--even so far as to ask me what her situation is...  This is after months of trying to woo a little bit (as times are hard, living situation). Like, we've been living together for 6 months.  Mind you--my sister would be the last person to date her aside the fact she's straight. And guess what...I actually feel bad for saying that cause...in my eyes, they're both people I really care for.  *sigh*  Unfortunately, fortunately...NEXT'"
15,Lost a $50 I just realized I dropped $50 at the gas station a couple of hours ago and now I mad at self &gt;:[  How better making?
16,"""is there anything I can do for you during this hard time?"" Well actually, we have a GoFundMe set up because we can't afford a funeral. ""I'll be sure to share it and not donate a dime"" My Aunt passed away unexpectedly 2 days ago. My family and I got a tremendous amount of ""thoughts and prayers"" and not a single donation towards be the funeral. Screw your thoughts and prayers and condolences and empty ""let me know what I can do for you"" statements. You could skip getting your car washed this week and give us the extra 5 bucks you saved. 60 shares of the fundraiser and 0 donations. 60 people leave $50 and that's $3,000!! We finally got a donation last night and it's from a complete stranger. Someone we've never met can stumble upon our GoFundMe and give us $150 but best friends and close family can't spare a dollar?   Phew. I didn't even know there was a rant subreddit, glad I checked."
17,"I fucking hate ants. A fire ant just stung my nut sack. I am not kidding.   I live in Texas, and theres a lot of fire ants here. So I am just sitting in my room, minding my own business when suddenly I feel a poking sensation on my nutsack. Which was the bite. Then I feel what felt like my nuts being dipped in boiling oil. The fucker stung my nuts for no reason.  Ants suck ass.   Edit: I don’t have any other ants in my house, thanks for the advice but the ant most likely clung to my pants when I was outside. But I’ll remember the advice for when I do have an ant problem!"
18,"Dear ""Love all sizes or you're shallow"" people I agree that people shouldn't be made fun or discriminate for their weight but you can't control everything. People can decide to ""diet"" or work out plans and share their weight loss goals without you feeling attacked. I want to lose about 15lbs, not because I am brain wasted to believe that I'm not beautiful, because I personally don't like what I have going on right now. Honestly not sorry if this offends you, if you're offended from it then you should look within yourself."
19,"Writers should support each other you selfish assholes If I'm gonna go through the trouble of reading and commenting on y'all's work you could at least take a look at some of mine. I know I'm persona non grata because I write erotica but I've got other stuff up there too. I feel like I'm writing into the void.     I don't want to stop writing what I love just because other people don't like it, but it also hurts to be ignored all the time."
20,"I know I have bad skin, thanks for reminding me though You don't need to point it out to me. I'm already painfully aware of it. It's something I'm massively self-conscious about, but life has to go on. I've tried just about every form of treatment under the sun, with varying degrees of success. Making obvious suggestions like ""Have you tried cleansing?"" is an insult both to my appearance and my intelligence. You're pointing out something I'm super embarrassed about and can't seem to fix, no matter how hard I try. It serves no purpose except to make me feel worse.   Also, yes, my makeup is cakey. I know. It's not because I think it looks great; it's just what happens when you try to cover skin with rosacea, enlarged pores and acne scarring. I use primer and try not to be too heavy-handed with my foundation, but no amount of skill in the world can hide the fact that I'm starting with a rough canvas.   TL;DR, I know my skin sucks, so STFU. "
21,"Stop pretending to have an illness, to seem above of me. My title probably makes no sense but, let me explain. There is a person lets call her Kayla (no offence if this is your name).  I have discontinued all contact with her, and blocked her on all social media. I don't need the toxicity of her in my already kinda stressful life  Kayla claims to have so many problems (mental and physical.) However, many of these are fake. I give the benefit of the doubt and will believe what you tell me. But, then I started noticing things. Firstly, Kayla would use her 'illnesses' as an excuse for things. Like ""oh, I can't do *insert thing here* because of my anxiety"" or something like that.   Also, I have problems myself (mental, not sure about medical. Other than a nose bleeding problem, but that is nothing serious, a trip to the ENT will cover that) but, she claims because she has more problems and that they are more severe that she knows more about the problems and that she also can basically take control over me, be smarter and better than me.   Kayla is quite popular and stuff and does cheer-leading, gymnastics, dance (i think), volleyball, soccer (i'm not sure if there is anything else.) Not far too long ago, I did some research. With her claims on some of the 'conditions' she has, she would not be able to do any of the sports or any sports at all really.  Also, she claims she has epileptic seizures (Photosensitive epilepsy to be specific) Here are two straight out reasons that's clearly a lie. 1) She went to a f***ing Taylor Swift concert (that is flashing lights galore, you would probably not survive that or something) 2) I have never seen her take medications (I have been over to her house plenty of times, including for sleepovers and had never seen her take a single medication)  She also claims to have autism. Which kinda hits close to home for me. I have a family friend with autism. I know there are different types on the Autism Spectrum but she has 0 signs/symptoms of any of them.   She just claims to have so many things she doesn't have. Is the possibility of munchausen syndrome there, well possibly. Like I said often i give the benefit of the doubt, this could be a case of it. But, at the same time it could just be her trying to seem 'trendy' or something. "
22,Just remember Yelp reviews are left by people who leave yelp reviews!
23,"Constipated for over a month And it keeps getting fucking worse. People telling me it'll be ok. First time when I got real pain I went to the ER (dunno if that's the right word) and I got some fibre supplements (2 a day), it worked, a little, but still not enough. Then on my own initiative I got laxative pills (Talked to my doctor about it) and they worked a little too. But it still wasn't over and I kept feeling more and more bloated.  &amp;#x200B;  Now fast forward to when it really started bothering me again, like, 3 weeks in, my doctor upped my dosis of fibre supplements to 6 per day and 2 laxative pills per day. I also had a few tiny 5 ML enemas that kinda...? worked. Few weeks later, back at the ER after waiting for my doctor's go ahead. Pains that have held for about 12 hours.  &amp;#x200B;  Have to wait for hours to get somewhere; get an unsolicited finger up my ass, an hour later an enema (that did not work as well as intended)  &amp;#x200B;  There was blood and slime present, so who knows, maybe I got  Ulcerative Colitis (Cause my mother has it) but the doctor said it was likely due to the enema.  &amp;#x200B;  I got one to take home, failed kinda. Then took another one the next day, worked, kinda? But still feel like there's a balloon inflated in my stomach and it's just so fucking annoying, I can barely eat anything without getting full, but eating nothing isn't an option either because then my intestines will just stop moving alltogether  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah...   &amp;#x200B;  Oh, and did I mention I had surgery a few weeks ago, and I'm still recovering from that?"
24,"I hate depression memes I saw the truth hole comic on the front page today, and I’m just sick of it. I’m sick of seeing everyone be miserable. I’m sick of feeling miserable. I’m sick of hearing everyone have these cliche dark jokes on nembutal and exit bags. I just want to shut my eyes and not see this epidemic happening. It’s like when every celebrity came out with their own unique criticisms of Trump. I can’t hear the news anymore. I feel like I’m hearing about these suicides occurring within a broad range of people, and I just don’t want to hear it anymore. All I want to say is, I sympathize with the situation, but it just doesn’t get us closer to reducing suicides. "
25,"Why me Why am Is this break up hitting me so hard? Why do I feel this way if I broke up with her? Why is this making me act so crazy? Why is she acting like she doesn’t care? Why did she tell me was stuck on her ex after we broke up? Why did she let me waste so much time? Just why she was supposed to be the one? I gave her everything she deserved and more, treated her like a queen and didnt get any of the same treatment and I was the only one trying but not all of sudden super heart broken because we broke up.. I dont get it"
26,I just saw a small roach and a little bug in my bed.... I'm concern...should I start buying a new mattress....I don't even know if the small bug is a bed bug....
27,"I hate to develop my feelings for someone!!!! I'm tired of developing my feelings for someone who I have no chance with!!! Few years ago, I swore that my crush was going to be last guy I have feelings for! I thought he might likes me but I was wrong because he got a girlfriend a year later. I am not going to like a guy again unless he likes me first! Last year, I unfortunately developed my feelings for another guy and I didn't try to!!! I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do! I still have feeling for him after a year... He doesn't know that I like him but he doesn't need to know.  This time, he is going to be LAST guy I have feelings for! After that, I am done!!! A guy should develop his feelings for me first! I'm tired of being hurt all time! I'm tired of possible one-sided love! I want mutual feelings! I'm sooo tired of this crap!! Why did I have to develop my feelings for someone??? I didn't try to!!! I tried to deny my feelings and in my mind, I was like, ""No, don't like him! Please don't fall for him! He is definitely a friend! No more than a friend."" Unfortunately, I fell for him!!! I'm so fed up!!"
28,"I cannot stand my best friend of over 5 years anymore. She is getting so fucking irritating! Not only do i get paragraphs sent to me every 3-4 hours about her life, I get criticized when I give the simple solution that could solve all of her problems that she is complaining to me about. I’m done with it. I am basically her personal therapist and it is killing me inside. Her life is kind of rough, but she could make it better by just doing some simple things! She also doesn’t really know anything about me anymore. It’s a one way friendship. She got pissed off when she heard about the new romantic interest in my life from someone else. Maybe she would’ve known if she didn’t talk about herself 24/7. I really cannot deal with her. "
29,"Fuckin' Tom Yorke And Simon and Garfunkel...and Damien Rice. I can't make a career out of the sadness and general depression I feel inside, because I have no talent. I'm called selfish, immature, ungrateful, unwilling to snap out of it, etc., and they're making millions off of it. The ""it"" I speak of is the crushing weight of the world and the general emptiness and sadness one feels when they're depressed. They were able to create lyrics from it, and were able to entertain millions from it. I on the other hand cannot sing, write music, play instruments, etc. I can't direct films or do any kind of entertainment that stems from inspiration caused by my mental illness. I just have it. Wish I could put it into words or songs or movies or fuckin videogames or something so I could capitalize on it. But no. I have to suffer and be ridiculed. "
30,BetterHelp I applied to BetterHelp to get therapy and they turned me away. Apparently in their eyes I'm beyond help or they're too shitty to help someone who's suicidal.  I figured it would be more convenient since i usually want to discuss my feelings at night/early morning plus it would save on gas.   A fucking app that is all about therapy turned me away because i need therapy. What a fucking pile of shit.
31,"I hate my family All they do is look down at me. If I’m doing something beneficial for myself, then they copy what I do. I don’t speak with them even though we live in the same house. Everyone is hating on me and wants to see me fail so they can feel better about themselves. There’s no support whatsoever and there is no confidentiality with them. It’s like living with your worst enemies, it’s toxic. I hope to graduate soon so I can move out. I will cut contact with them as soon as that occurs 100%."
32,I deserve to be unhealthy unhappy and tired 
33,"I’m so tired of not having it be an ideal situation to be happy. I’m so fucking tired of this shit. Four year relationship ended because I couldn’t pursue a university in the country of both our choices because my dad lost his job my mom got cancer and I had to stay and help. I hate it here so fucking much but I’m stuck for atleast two more years. Anyways, ever since then it’s been nothing but pointless emotionless hookups and one to two week relationships. I’ve been talking to this girl I met online for about 9 years now, she’s my best friend, we know everything about each other  and oh my lord I love her so much and she feels the same way but she lives on the other side of the world so rip I guess. A while ago I reconnected with an old friend, we both ended up admitting we liked each other in high school and ever since spending time with each other we found out those feelings are still there  and since then sparks went flying ,but the amount of chances I got to kiss her and become more intimate got killed with the thought of not wanting to fuck up a friendship since a relationship is out of the question. since she’s only here for the summer and is going back to her home country next week. We even went on a fad date to see how it would be and it was amazing.  Another girl I liked after like a year of having no chemistry with anyone, yeah my friend screwed that up for me. Not going into details but let’s just say he’s a jackass. Before all of this even happened the first girl I ever went out with, she was amazing and we where a perfect match. I only ended up going out with for two days because well what do you know, when I went to tell my best friend at the time about her, I find out hes had a crush on her for years and it was hurting his feelings and so I backed off. Only to talk to her last night after years and years of no contact to her asking me why I broke it off with her to me admitting it. Only to find out that she rejected him way before she even met me because they went on a date and afterwards he told the entire fucking city that she slept with him when she didn’t. I am so tired of all this shit and never even getting a chance to be happy with someone because of such stupid little hiccups , I want to cry , but I haven’t cried in years and I try to force out a tear to just try to get some emotion out but I just can’t it feels like shit. And that’s why I’m writing here on a brand new account even though I can write it in my main and everyone will see, I usually don’t care and am an open book but right now I just feel so pathetic. "
34,"Every single one of my friends is my best friend, but I’m no one’s best friend. I know it sounds like a middle school existential crisis, but I’m not in middle school and it still hurts... a lot. I’m there for everyone, and I try not to be a people pleaser, but I am and I’m still no one’s best friend. Do you know how hard it is to not have anyone to talk about serious things? Or not have a person who’s comfortable enough around you to talk about their problems with you? It really makes me feel like I don’t matter.  And when I actually try to talk about my problems with my friends, they either take it as a joke, not pay attention while I talk, or think I’m exaggerating, and that makes me feel like my problems don’t matter either. This is really painful, and I never say it to anyone, I just keep it to myself. "
35,"Im afraid my relationship w my boyfriend is ending We have been dating for three months. Said the I love yous pretty early. I went to college about a month ago and two weeks ago he broke up w me (over text) bc he didn't think he could handle a long distance relationship (even though when we met, we live an hour away and now we live... A whole... Two hours away now!)(but I mean.. props to him for being somewhat honorable and not just cheating on me right?) And after I sort of kind of went not really but sorta went off on him (I mean I told him how I felt. But I didn't say it angrily or mean. I was never angry with him. Just really sad) he kinda sorta not really begged for me back (it took a whole lotta convincing). I went to ""spend the weekend"" with him for the first time ever and things were kind of weird. Not weird we just didn't talk a whole lot. It was kinda like ""old"" times (as old as you can get in 3 months) but there was just less talking and more watching TV and sex ya know. That was this last Friday and now it's Wednesday and he's working and I'm at band camp and we can't talk a whole lot. And his work puts him in a lot of physical stress so when he says he's tired I don't really text him a lot and this week's been particularly taxing on him...  I'm just scared it's gonna happen again. I suddenly have this insecurity about us and it feels just awful. I know he loves me. I told him if we broke up again it would be the final time. I'm just scared"
36,"Self Doubt! I wish I was something more. I only want to do better. I want to give more than what I have. I wish I was the best, I wish I was important, I wish I was someone people liked to talk to and be around. Myself as a whole is just not enough for a lot of people. No one cares to give me the time of day anyways. Those who do quickly lose interest. I wish I was someone better. I feel like no one gives me credit. I feel very unappreciated. Honestly, I wish people gave me validation! I feel very invalid. Inapplicable. I wish I was someone people looked forward to seeing. I wish I could feel important somewhere, anywhere on this earth. I put so much effort and time and dedication into shit just to get nothing in return and it's been like that for years. Maybe I'm just putting my energy into the wrong shit. But where is the right thing for me? What is it?   I'm just putting this out there into the void of the internet. It's a place to scream, since there isnt any where else to anymore. "
37,"Schizoaffective Mother Draining My Energy and Making Me Feel Bad About Life My mother is diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. For those who do not know about this type of mental illness, it is basically a combination between Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. Her symptoms include mania and depression with an add-on depending on her delusion and paranoia.   Prior to us migrating to the US, I have always thought my mother was great when I was younger. However, the stress of living in the US in poverty was too much for her and the negative criticism from her family members broke her down and she developed Schizoaffective Disorder. I eventually was placed in foster care after an incident where her delusion resulted in her physically abusing me was witnessed by a residential manager where my mother and I stayed.  Foster care wasn't paradise but I learned a lot from being in numerous placements. I understood how other culture operated and how a normal family was supposed to run from the sideline. I have always understood that the family that I was placed with are not my blood and there are barriers because of that - realizing it made me sad at first and it still do but that's the reality of nature. Throughout my foster care years, my mother was on and off her meds before she finally stabilized for a long period of time throughout my high school and college years.   Recently, she went off her meds again and that was an ordeal that I won't soon forget. I have made several posts about that in r/needavice but I won't mentioned that here because I wanted to rant about the emotions that I am feeling reeling from my mother's behaviors.   My mother is currently getting an injection every month (which I hope she is telling me the truth about that) so she's somewhat stable. I feel so suffocated by my mother in a sense that I feel that I might step on a landmine everyday having her in my life. When she recently went off her meds, I asked her why she wasn't taking her meds and she said it was because she was angry at my uncle and me. I didn't say it straight to her but I thought to myself that it was unfair that she would punish our stable lives by going off her meds. Just last week, she saw a picture of me at my Aunt's place and she got sad saying why did I visited my Aunt instead of her. I tried telling her that when she was off her meds my Aunt/ her best friend was extremely helpful in making sure that she's okay. She was the one that acted like a mother to me when my own mother was yelling on the street and having delusion thoughts. During her episodes, I was so scared of her and my Aunt was there for me to help and give me the support for me call the police/ help for my mother. When I told her that, my mother interpreted that I don't love her but all I was trying to make her understand that I am just a kid and I am scared of you when you're off your meds.   My mother gets angry easily by things that don't go her ways. There's no logical reasoning to her. Every time I tried to reason my perspective with her she said that she's older than me and that I have to listen to her and that I don't know anything. If I continue to press my opinion on a matter then she would throw something like if anyone that she doesn't like (my uncle/ her brother or my aunt/ best friend) have taught me to say these things to her. I feel abuse and this severely hurt my self-esteem as it seems like I can't even hold my own perspective/ opinion about anything.   As I said, my mother have a hard time to getting along with people. While my uncle is her brother and aunt is her best friend, if she gets mad at them then she won't talk or call them, in turns they just avoid her until she needs their help. I have a hard time following the same strategy as they do because I want my mom to be well. It's just difficult to be interactive with my mother. I have to watch what I say and what I do around her for her to not be angry at me. Although I live close to my mother, I have been lying to her about where I live because I don't feel comfortable with telling her my new place where she might show up with an episode and cause a scene.   Because of my past, I have been a passive person and never liked confrontation. I have observed and concluded that my mother holds grudges about what have happened. I have multiple times tell her that she has to let go of the past and be happy but she insist that whoever have done us wrong in the past we must return the favors. She doesn't connect well with others and instead put a lot of pressure on me to give her the love of a community and unrequited which I am happy to if she would return the logicality and understanding that I am looking for. But she does not and I feel discouraged, sad, angry, disappointed, worrisome, and anxious whenever I talk to her.   I have been involved in my mother's case planning with disabilities services and they're disappointing. Multiple times, I have to chase service providers down and play phone chase with them just to get updates on my mother. The timetables that they give me are never accurate about when they would return my calls or give me the information that I need to help my mother.   I have talked to my support group which includes my mentor, friends, extended-family members, and foster family and they have given me some advice but I still feel isolated. My mentor have told me that even if I move away and cut off all my contact with my mother then I would not be satisfied because I would worry about her.   Right now, I feel bleak and despair. I know life is unfair but when do things look up from here. I feel alone and too immature to handle this kind of situation. I feel that I don't have the permission to live the life that I want to live but rather picking up the messes that my mother leave behind and having to entertain her. Maybe I am whining and I apologized if I am because I know there are worst lives out there than me. Thank you for listening to my story. "
38,"Why I can’t get over her My girlfriend and I broke up about two months ago. It was her decision and all of my fault for not thinking anything through before I go ahead with it. These things aren’t too serious but they are in the category of making and following through with plans. Looking from the outside in with our relationship one would question a lot of the things I did that made her angry and the things she said after the fact. All of that in mind I can’t help but feel guilty with all of the stuff I have done and I am completely responsible for the downfall of our relationship. I ruined one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. 2 years I had the chance to wake up and fix myself but I didn’t. I was selfish, inattentive to her needs, and worst of all lazy.   I had two chances to fix myself when we broke up but all of that went to waste. I don’t blame anyone for telling me to move on but I can’t right now. Despite my shortcomings I loved her and helped her through the worst period in her life. When all of those things happened I was right by her side no matter what. I loved her personality, her past, her aspirations, and her flaws most of all. I was never one to send surprises but I was one to sacrifice almost everything to make sure she was okay. I know I have to give up my love for her some day but for now i’ll hold onto it and treasure it. I hope all of you that read this take the time to treasure the people that you have fallen in love with.   We often take for granted what we have become accustomed to and when it is gone it may very well be our downfall. Be kind to each other, cast aside your pride when the time is right, and most of all fight to change the setbacks of your relationships. "
39,"pls stop i just so tired of due dates and summative stuff due, on top of that are summative performances and exams. Just so sick from the work, it keeps on coming like wave after wave. The workload piling up so much that it blocked my view of the light.  friends and family Expecting me to do well but little do they know that im the black sheep. Getting out of bed is such a pain that i want to go to bed again, not to sleep but to lay there and do nothing. I cant think straight with all the weight on my shoulders, i try to look strong by putting on a smile and telling people nothings wrong. so sick of this year, so sick of my life, so sick of all these problems. Just wanna feel to be alive again. Sorry if this dont make any sense, i needed to rant.   &amp;#x200B;"
40,"I'm tired of trying to be better. I wish I could just self destruct in peace. I wish I could just stop talking to everyone who cares and drink myself into oblivion. I regret joining AA. I regret getting therapy. I regret making sober friends who care if I drink or not.   If I wasnt taking up their time (my friends, therapist, sponsor) they would have taken someone else under their wing. They would have more time to help people who were better then me and more willing to change.   I want to give up. I'm tired of trying to get better. It's fucking exhausting and I'm just so fucking tired of it all"
